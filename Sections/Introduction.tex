The purposes of this document are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To improve awareness of the impact that high energy physics, cosmology and astroparticle physics, and hadron and nuclear physics (\acrshort{hecap}) has on the environment.
    \item To provide suggestions and encourage immediate action on ways that we, as a community, can play our part in limiting further degradation of the world's climate and ecosystems.
    \item To provide impetus for ongoing and collective discussions of how we can make positive changes to our community's work practices, in terms of environmental sustainability and for the issues of social justice from which climate change and environmental degradation cannot be disentangled.
\end{itemize}
The discussions are divided into seven sections. Sections 2 through 7 cover the topics of Computing, Energy, Food, Mobility, Research Infrastructure and Technology, and Resources and Waste. Each of these sections contains a set of recommendations, for individuals, groups and institutions, and these are followed by longer discussions that include case studies and best practice examples, which can be read independently of the surrounding material. Collated lists of acronyms and abbreviations, best practices, case studies, and figures and tables are included at the end of this document.

\sref{sec:Introduction}, Preliminaries, begins by acknowledging the climate crisis and the environmental impacts of HECAP+ research. It provides a summary of the United Nations (\acrshort{un}) Sustainable Development Goals (\acrshort{sdg}) and how these relate to \ACR\ research, and briefly reviews similar and complementary documents.

\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:Introduction}

\subsection{Introduction}

The 2021 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (\acrshort{ipcc})~\cite{IPCC2021report} is emphatic in its statements about the current status of the climate and the damaging impact that humanity continues to have upon it~\cite{IPCC2021reportSPM}:
\begin{quotation}
"It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred.\ [\dots]\ Human-induced climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region 
across the globe. Evidence of observed changes in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, 
and tropical cyclones, and, in particular, their attribution to human influence, has strengthened since [the Fifth Assessment Report in 2014]."
\end{quotation}
It is also clear on the consequences of further inaction~\cite{IPCC2021reportSPM}:
\begin{quotation}
"Global surface temperature will continue to increase until at least mid-century under all emissions scenarios
considered. Global warming of 1.5 °C and 2 °C will be exceeded during the 21$^\text{st}$ century unless deep reductions 
in $\mathrm{CO_2}$ and other  gas emissions occur in the coming decades.\ [\dots]\ Many changes in the climate system become larger in direct relation to increasing global warming. They 
include increases in the frequency and intensity of hot extremes, marine heatwaves, heavy precipitation, 
and, in some regions, agricultural and ecological droughts; an increase in the proportion of intense tropical 
cyclones; and reductions in Arctic sea ice, snow cover and permafrost."
\end{quotation}

Net global \acrshort{co2e} emissions must be halved before 2030 to fulfill the Paris Climate Agreement. Without this, we are unlikely to meet the  target of limiting global warming to $1.5^\circ$C in order to avoid fatal tipping points in the global biosphere (see \fref{fig:ene-netco2})~\cite{IPCC19policy}. Pledged policy changes by nations party to the Paris Agreement, known as Nationally Determined Contributions, are insufficiently far-reaching, and ``make it {\it likely} that warming will exceed 1.5\degree\ during the 21st century''~\cite{IPCC2023SynthesisSPM} (original emphasis).  Demand-side mitigation, including changes in infrastructure use and social and behavioural practices, can reduce global GHG emissions in end-use sectors by 40-70\% by 2050~\cite{IPCC2022reportSPM}.  Carbon offsetting via verified providers of Removal Units (\acrshort{rmu}s), Emission Reduction Units (\acrshort{eru}s) or Certified Emission Reduction (\acrshort{cer}s) units (see Ref.~\cite{Uni22}) should be seen as a last resort, used only once all other options for reducing the CO$_2$e emissions have been exhausted and to offset any residual CO$_2$e output.

        {According to the IPCC, the global net \CdO\ emissions have to come down to zero to limit global warming. To avoid irreversible tipping points, mitigation pathways should limit warming to 1.5°C, which requires deep, rapid and sustained emission reductions.  Pledged policy changes announced up until October 2021 by nations party to the Paris Climate Agreement are insufficient to meet this goal.

Oxfam's recent publication "Confronting carbon inequality"~\cite{Oxfam2020} notes a strong correlation between greenhouse gas (\acrshort{ghg}) emissions and income level, with the world's wealthiest 10\% accounting for over half of cumulative global emissions (see \fref{fig:OxfamFig} for infographic). This income bracket, corresponding to an average annual income of over \euro{34,000}, includes many \ACR\ physicists, and was identified by the IPCC as having ``the greatest potential for emissions reductions, \eg\ as citizens, investors, consumers, role models, and professionals''~\cite{IPCC2022reportSPM}.

        {Distribution of 2016 global GHG emissions by sector, compared with CERN emissions for 2019, during LHC shutdown. Data are taken from Ref.~\cite{OWIDGHGSector} and CERN Environmental Reports~\cite{Environment:2737239,CERN:2723123}. Note that the CERN procurement figures are estimated with a spend-based method~\cite{SpendBased} using the ecoinvent Database~\cite{ecoinvent}. The results therefore have a large margin of error and should be interpreted with care. \label{fig:intro-GlobalEmissions}}
    \end{figure}
%%%%%

\fref{fig:intro-GlobalEmissions} presents a breakdown of 2016 global GHG emissions for by sector, with the emissions at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (\acrshort{cern}) for 2019, during LHC shutdown, shown as a proxy for research emissions.~\footnote{Note that direct and indirect emissions more than double when the LHC is operational.}  CERN, like other \ACR\ institutions, categorises its emissions by scope rather than sector, making a direct comparison difficult.  Instead, we can consider total
per-capita emissions, dividing CERN's emissions equally amongst its seventeen thousand Users (scientists involved in CERN-based research), to obtain roughly 15 \tCdOe\ per researcher per annum, or twice the global average of 6.3 \tCdOe.  Note that this does not include personal household emissions for researchers, which may exceed their workplace emissions.  It also incorrectly assigns some emissions due to CERN's smaller cohort of direct personnel, \eg\ due to CERN-funded travel or personal computing equipment, to its entire User base.  For a fairer accounting, see \fref{fig:Intro-ComparativeEmissions}.  This chart attributes work-related emissions in each sector to the `true' consumers of each resource, for researchers at CERN as well as four other \ACR\ institutions, the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (\acrshort{mpia}) in Heidelberg, Germany, the Department of Physics (D-Phys) at \acrshort{eth}, \acrshort{nikhef} in the Netherlands, and Fermilab in Chicago, USA \acrshort{fnal}).  For raw data and details of underlying methodology see Appendix~\ref{sec:DataforFig1.4}.  Since many institutional estimates do not yet fully account for Scope 3 emissions, the numbers in this chart should be taken as indicative only, and caution should be employed in making comparisons across institutions on this basis.  It is nevertheless evident that work-related emissions for many of us far exceed our remaining budget to stay within 
1.5\degree C of warming~\cite{IPCC2021reportSPM}. \footnote{The per capita budget is computed using an emissions budget of 420 G\tCdOe\, and an average world population of 8.8 billion.} 

These work-related emissions are due to choices we make, as individuals, collaborations, or institutions.  They could be a direct consequence of \ACR\ research, such as the choice of detector design; computing setup or software pipeline for simulation and analysis; or how we collaborate or communicate the results of our work.  Alternatively they could be peripherally related to the science we do: how we commute between our home and workplace, for example, or the food we consume whilst at work; or how our offices are powered, heated and ventilated. 
Historically, many of these choices have been made prioritising cost or convenience over environmental and social impact.  However, the rapid and systematic societal change needed to keep to our climate change goals requires system-wide engagement at all levels of academia.  We can impel positive change throughout the academic system by re-assessing these choices and how central they are to our primary function as scientists.

%%%%%

\begin{bestpractice}[Nikhef renovation and sustainability plan\label{BP:Nikhef}]{Nikhef renovation and sustainability plan}%
    Nikhef is the Dutch National Institute for Subatomic Physics in the Netherlands. It is both a consortium of universities and an institution with a building in Amsterdam. The total \CdO\ footprint of Nikhef was 1,082 \tCdOe\ in 2019,\footnote{We report the 2019 numbers, since the 2020 numbers may be unrepresentative due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.} three quarters of which is due to flying to conferences and labs, and 15\% is due to heating the building with natural gas~\cite{Nikhef}. The building is undergoing a major renovation in 2021--2023, which will remove the need of gas for heating. Instead, the heat from the nearby data centre will be used, in addition to better thermal insulation of the building. More generally, however, renovations of buildings dating from last century quickly pay off in energy bills and have a positive impact on the climate.

    The Nikhef sustainability roadmap~\cite{Nikhef} covers all sources of direct and indirect carbon emissions. For instance, by 2030, air travel should be reduced by 50\% and daily commuting should be climate-neutral.  Intermediate targets for 2025 are also set and yearly emissions will be monitored and reported.
\end{bestpractice}

%%%%%

This process has already begun. Universities and other institutions are including sustainability in buildings planning (see \bpref{BP:Nikhef}) and engaging with voluntary assessments of the environmental sustainability of their research facilities (see \eg~Refs.~\cite{Environment:2737239, Jahnke2020, Beisert2020, Nikhef, FermilabEnvReport2019}). Examples focussed on the environmental sustainability of laboratories include University College London’s Laboratory Efficiency Assessment Framework (\acrshort{leaf}) initiative~\cite{LEAF_framework, LEAF_take_part}, a standard being adopted across an increasing number of universities~\cite{LEAF_impact}. The LEAF initiative, which awards three levels of certification to participating laboratories, is structured around online tools that promote best practice, and aid calculations of impact and reporting, as well as additional resources and training opportunities for staff and students.

Moreover the integrated estimate assumes emissions per capita that are constant in time.

    \label{fig:Intro-EffectiveEmissionsReduction}
\end{center} 
Our workplace emissions can be compared to the most significant sources of personal emissions. Figure~\ref{fig:Intro-EffectiveEmissionsReduction} shows the conclusions of a recent meta-study from Lund University~\cite{Wynes_2017}, in which individual climate actions were ordered by impact.  Note that the authors assume ``average conditions in developed countries'', so miss the substantial differences between emissions levels in developing and developed nations.  They also neglect the effects of climate policy.  For one estimate of how national climate policies might modify the ordering, see Ref.~\cite{FoundersPledge}. This figure highlights the disconnect between the moderate-impact measures (right-most five bars) that consumers are commonly encouraged to take, and the high-impact measures (left-most seven bars) that pertain to more complex and nuanced issues.\footnote{The left-most bar, the climate cost of having an additional child, relies on the assumption that global emissions per capita remain frozen at their 2005 value.  The 2009 study from which this estimate was taken~\cite{MURTAUGH200914} also quotes results assuming two alternative
emissions scenarios considered in the 2007 IPCC report:~an `optimistic' scenario, in which emissions per capita decrease linearly to 0.5 \tCdOe\ by 2100, and a `pessimistic' one, in which they increase linearly to 150\% of their 2005 value of 4.3 \tCdOe.  The systematic uncertainty in the result due to this choice is huge, with the estimated cost of having an additional child ranging from 4.6 \tCdOe\ in the optimistic scenario, to 81 \tCdOe\ in the pessimistic one.  The lower and upper limits of this range were obtained by dividing the lifetime emissions per child in each case, by the average human lifespan, as reported in Ref.~\cite{UN2019}, in the developed country in question.
This still raises the question of how responsibility for the emissions of future generations should be allocated, given that children are essential to the functioning of our society and institutions.}
A full discussion of these issues is beyond the scope of this document.

\subsection{Previous and Parallel Initiatives}
\label{sec:other_initiatives}

This document is focused on environmental and social justice issues of particular relevance to the activities of \ACR.  This section provides a brief review of other documents with similar and complementary focuses on environmental sustainability.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{ALLEA, Towards Climate Sustainability of the Academic System in Europe and Beyond}

The All European Academies (\acrshort{allea}) Working Group on Climate Sustainability in the Academic System published a report in May 2022~\cite{ALLEA}, the aim of which is "to  assess current practices and to critically examine current and proposed measures." 
The document urges stakeholders --- either individual (researchers and students) or structural (universities, funding bodies, conference organisers, ranking agencies, and
policy makers) --- to know their roles and responsibilities toward a climate-sustainable academic system.
After summarizing available data on GHG emissions from various stakeholders and reviewing
the current practices aimed at reducing those
emissions, the report outlines recommendations for individual and group stakeholders. 
Dimensions of social justice and equity are among the principles underlying all recommendations, as well as the opportunity for the academic system to be a role model in the matter. 
While all group stakeholders are advised to embed sustainability in their strategies, individual ones differ:\ students and academic members are encouraged to hold university management accountable, to demand divestment and to generate awareness. 
The importance of the development of an evidence base is emphasised, along with mix-and-match approaches to meeting formats. 
Finally, stakeholders are pushed to allocate funding to the decarbonization of the academic system.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Snowmass Contribution, Climate Impacts of Particle Physics}

The report "Climate impacts of particle physics"~\cite{Bloom:2022gux}, submitted to the proceedings of the US Community Study on the Future of Particle Physics (Snowmass 2021) focuses on facility construction, detector gases, computing, and GHG emissions from particle physics laboratories. 
The report highlights two key motivations for addressing the ecological and climate impacts of particle physics: (i) that the particle physics community has a moral obligation to do so and (ii) that its professional activities will be under increasing scrutiny from a number of stakeholders. 
The latter means that the community will be under increasing pressure to justify its carbon emissions against its relative size, compared to other industries, and its societal benefits.

As a concrete example, the report focuses on the Future Circular Collider (\acrshort{fcc}) --- the proposed 100 TeV electron-positron (and later hadron) collider. 
The authors estimate that the construction of the roughly 100 km circumference tunnel alone would lead to \CdO\ emissions at the level of a few hundred kilotons, several times more than other large US building projects.
This corresponds to "per physicist" emissions 80 times larger than their estimated 1.1 \acrshort{tco2}\ per capita per year limit needed to keep global warming to less that 1.5\degree C. The authors emphasise the significant impact of the GHGs used in particle physics detectors and for cooling, which can have warming potential that exceeds that of \CdO\ by as much as four orders of magnitude (in the case of ${\rm SF}_6$).  
The report then highlights a number of avenues for reducing the GHG emissions due to the electricity consumption of computing, which is pivotal to running and exploiting such facilities. It also discusses the additional emissions due to collaborative research activities, with a particular emphasis on taking careful steps to reduce air travel that capitalise on potential benefits for social justice while minimising unintended negative consequences for members of the community.

The report's recommendations stress the need for reporting on planned emissions and energy usage for new facilities; standardised reporting of emissions across the sector, and community-wide engagement to tackle the negative climate impacts of particle physics research through dedicated research time.

\subsubsection{Recommendations by the yHEP association in Germany}

The young High Energy Physicists (\acrshort{yhep}) association in Germany published the "yHEP recommendations on improvement of environmental sustainability in science"~\cite{yHEP1} and its Addendum~\cite{yHEP2} in December 2020 and 2021, respectively. The documents, which were the result of proposals from the yHEP community, including HECAP, nuclear and hadronic, and accelerator physicists, contain ideas for improving the environmental sustainability of basic research. %research among the yHEP members, covering the yHEP sections: particle physics, astroparticle physics, physics of nucleons and hadrons, and since 2021, accelerator physics. The document was forged from the community ideas by the yHEP management and after iterations in the community released on the yHEP webpage.
They take qualitative approach on a broad range of topics, including, but not limited to, travel, conferences, computing and infrastructure, resource management and financing, and green energy. 
%canteens, computing and buildings, purchases, funds and resource management, environmental awareness training, sustainability in research funding, green energy, as well as investments in green research \& development. 
%The documents do not contain a quantitative analysis, but cover similar topics as this document and can be seen as a complement to the recommendations in this document.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Impelling Positive Change}

The aim of this document is to provide a comprehensive discussion of the various impacts of \ACR\ research, from our day-to-day activities through to the large infrastructure projects on which our science depends. The discussions presented here have much in common with those of the documents described in \sref{sec:other_initiatives}. This document is, however, intended to have broad scope and, through case studies and best practice, to illustrate potential actions that can be implemented at individual, group and institutional levels to limit the impacts of \ACR\ research on the world's climate and ecosystems.

However, if the \ACR\ community is to succeed in improving the sustainability of its working practices, then the environment and related issues of social justice must be recognised as integral parts of the planning and management of our research activities. With this in mind, we collect below a list of recommendations for structural changes to the organisation of our community, our training and our professional development.

These recommendations complement those listed in the discussions of specific sources of environmental impacts of \ACR\ research on which the bulk of this document focuses. Together, these provide concrete suggestions of ways in which the \ACR\ community can act to reduce its negative climate and ecological impacts, and address issues of social justice in line with the United Nations Sustainability Goals, discussed in the next subsection.

%%%%%

As a global research community of people in \ACR, we have an impact on society all over the world.
We contribute to society's knowledge with facts that shape the way the Universe is understood. Furthermore, we drive innovation and have reliable funding through institutions, which is being used to employ many individuals and invest in infrastructure.
This makes the institutes of the \ACR\ community a significant factor in their local economic systems.
They provide jobs and are often purchasers of goods and services.
This economic activity gives us leverage to demand that improvements to social and environmental standards be put in effect.

We also have a responsibility towards society to advance the sustainable development of the world.
This is why we, the \ACR\  community, support the UN SDGs (see \fref{fig:17_UN_SustGoals}). 
The topics discussed in this document are meant to support a multiplicity of these goals, and we aim to identify the influence of our work in all aspects. We have a higher impact on some goals than on others, and further work to quantify these impacts and the steps that the \ACR\ community can take to limit and ideally remove them require dedicated, on-going research beyond the scope of this document.

The Sustainable Development Goals are defined in  UN resolution A/RES/70/1 in detail~\cite{UNResolutionARES701}. The goals are listed below, followed by ways our work impacts on each respective goal. This list is not complete but is intended to inspire action to reach the goals in the many aspects of our daily scientific and personal lives.
