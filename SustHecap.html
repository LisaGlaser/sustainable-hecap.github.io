<p><strong>Environmental sustainability in basic research</strong><br />
<strong>A perspective from HECAP+</strong></p>
</div>
<p><br />
The climate crisis and the degradation of the world’s ecosystems require
humanity to take immediate action. The international scientific
community has a responsibility to limit the negative environmental
impacts of its research. The HECAP+ communities (High Energy Physics,
Cosmology, Astroparticle Physics, plus Hadron and Nuclear Physics) make
use of common and similar experimental infrastructure, such as
accelerators, and rely similarly on the processing of big data. Our
communities therefore face similar challenges to improving the
sustainability of our research. This document aims to reflect on the
environmental impacts of our work practices and research infrastructure,
to highlight best practice, to make recommendations for positive
changes, and to identify the opportunities and challenges that such
changes present for wider aspects of social responsibility.<br />

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="statement-of-intent">Statement of intent</h1>
<p>This reflective document was developed as part of a grassroots
initiative <span><em>Striving towards Environmental Sustainability in
High Energy Physics, Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics</em></span>. It
is intended to be a synthesis of current data and best practices from
research in climate science and sustainability, as applied to our fields
to the best of our ability as physicists, and a reflection on the roles
that our communities can play in limiting negative environmental impacts
due to our research work and scientific culture. The focus is not to
stipulate the research that our communities should undertake.</p>
<p>The scope is inspired by the holistic approach of annual
environmental reports of major institutes, which include emissions
directly related to research and collateral emissions, such as from
personal commutes and institutional catering. Continuing to address this
broad scope will require input from across the community, in particular
to identify the technical challenges of limiting the environmental
impacts of our current and future research infrastructure.</p>
<p>While this document is primarily framed from the perspective of
HECAP+, much of its discussion applies to basic research more generally.
It is intended to be a first step, and it is hoped that it may serve as
an example to ours and other fields.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the past century the ever increasing resource demands of humans
have a devastating impact on the climate of our planet. The resulting
heat waves, droughts, strong rain falls, violent storms, melting ice and
rising sea levels are posing an existential threat to many people
world-wide already today, and even more in the future. This situation
demands action from all of us individually, and as groups and
institutions, to do whatever we can to reduce (or ideally eliminate) the
emission of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span>(equivalent) gases, and more
generally to preserve the resources of the planet. This report
illustrates well that scientists working in the fields of high energy
physics, cosmology and astroparticle physics are using on average more
resources than what will be acceptable, and action is needed
immediately. Many recommendations are proposed for individuals, groups
and/or institutions. Some are rather easy while others are challenging
and require core habits to change. Given the very international nature
of the research performed in these fields, there is a large potential to
propagate the actions to 100s of institutions in countries of all
continents and thereby increasing the impact further. I very much hope
this document will help us embark on the right path.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Climate change does not necessarily threaten the survival of our
planet in the bigger picture of the solar system and the universe;
rather, it threatens our own survival and the survival of the bio- and
eco-spheres that we rely on for our subsistence in this cosmos. We have
no alternative planet which will provide for us, so we better not make
our current one uninhabitable. Climate research has been clear on the
effects of climate change, and slowly the rising sea levels, the
disappearance of glaciers, the frequency of hundred year floods, the
storms, droughts, and heat waves beat the message home: climate change
is happening, human action is the cause, and we better counter-act it
immediately. As fellow scientists from the areas of high energy physics,
cosmology, and astroparticle physics, we are trained to understand and
consider scientific results in our daily work. We know how to interpret
statistics and draw conclusions from data. This document is a start to
take the conclusions from climate research seriously and put them into
action in our own fields of research. Collecting and reflecting on
available results, together with recommendations for the implementation
— from easy to hard — is an important first step, but only a first step.
Let’s use this document and get started in transforming our field of
research into a sustainable field of research - for the benefit of our
planet and our own futures. The data has been clear for a while, now is
the time to act on it.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="sec:Executive_Summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>Humanity’s impact upon the world’s climate and ecosystems is now as
unequivocal as it is extreme <span class="citation"
data-cites="IPCC2021reportSPM"><sup>1</sup></span>. Averting this
climate catastrophe must be a critical concern for all global citizens
at this pivotal time in world history.</p>
<p><strong>High energy physics</strong>, <strong>cosmology</strong>,
<strong>astroparticle physics</strong>, and <strong>nuclear and hadronic
physics</strong> (<strong><span data-acronym-label="hecap"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">hecap</span></strong>) research has
direct impacts on the environment. Our accelerators, detectors, and
telescopes require enormous power generation, our computing
infrastructure is global and power-hungry, and we generate a large
amount of waste that is unsafe for the environment.</p>
<p>As scientists working in HECAP+ and related disciplines, our
responsibilities to limit and mitigate our impact on the world’s climate
and ecosystems are manifold. Our opportunities and training have given
us the science capital to appreciate the evidence that has been collated
over many years by climate and environmental science. We must use our
unique and privileged platform to impel positive changes in, as well as
educate and advocate on, environmental sustainability and the connected
issues of social justice. Moreover, as a community focused on basic
scientific research, we should be no less accountable for our impacts on
the world’s climate and ecosystems than any other industry, and we
should anticipate that our activities will come under increasing
scrutiny from the public, governments and funders. We have moral and
pragmatic obligations to act.</p>
<p>This document follows the holistic approach taken by several
HECAP+ institutions in their annual environmental reports in assessing
the environmental impacts of HECAP+ research across six
areas: computing, energy, food, mobility, research infrastructure and
technology, and resources and waste, also within the larger context of
global emissions. Specific recommendations are made for each of these
areas, but the overarching message is simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span><strong>Assessing, reporting on, defining targets for, and
undertaking coordinated efforts to limit our impacts on the world’s
climate and ecosystems must become an integral part of how we plan and
undertake all aspects of our research.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requires urgent action at an individual level, at a group level
(including research groups, collaborations and organising committees),
and at an institutional level (including universities, research
institutes, funding agencies, and professional societies). Moreover, it
requires systematic positive changes in everything from our day-to-day
activities and the ways we interact as a global community through to the
design and running of the ‘big science’ infrastructure on which
HECAP+ research depends.</p>
<p>We urge all members of the HECAP+ and related communities to take
individual actions and push for group- and institution-level changes
that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Consider the environmental cost of computational infrastructure
and algorithms in decision making and prioritise the development of
common and reusable software solutions across HECAP+.</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritise the use of sustainable and renewable energy to power
our workspaces and research infrastructure; increase their energy
efficiency and recovery, and energy storage capacity.</p></li>
<li><p>Move towards plant-based catering at conferences and in
cafeterias, immediately reducing the provision of carbon-intensive
foods, such as beef.</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritise environmentally sustainable modes of transport for
commuting where possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritise responsible business travel that balances in-person
and online meetings, acknowledges the benefits of virtual and hybrid
meetings for inclusivity, and considers the disproportionate impact of
changes to travel culture on different groups, e.g., early career
researchers.</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritise environmentally- and socially-sustainable sourcing of
raw materials for experiments and infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p>Propagate and expand the culture of “reduce, reuse, repair,
recycle”, including the implementation of lifecycle awareness and
end-of-life planning for hardware.</p></li>
<li><p>Educate and advocate on issues of environmental sustainability
and social justice, and engage more broadly with policy makers to push
for wider change, e.g., the improvement and decarbonization of local
transport infrastructure.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="outline">Outline</h1>
<p>The purposes of this document are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To improve awareness of the impact that high energy physics,
cosmology and astroparticle physics, and hadron and nuclear physics
(<span data-acronym-label="hecap"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">hecap</span>) has on the
environment.</p></li>
<li><p>To provide suggestions and encourage immediate action on ways
that we, as a community, can play our part in limiting further
degradation of the world’s climate and ecosystems.</p></li>
<li><p>To provide impetus for ongoing and collective discussions of how
we can make positive changes to our community’s work practices, in terms
of environmental sustainability and for the issues of social justice
from which climate change and environmental degradation cannot be
disentangled.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The discussions are divided into seven sections. Sections 2 through 7
cover the topics of Computing, Energy, Food, Mobility, Research
Infrastructure and Technology, and Resources and Waste. Each of these
sections contains a set of recommendations, for individuals, groups and
institutions, and these are followed by longer discussions that include
case studies and best practice examples, which can be read independently
of the surrounding material. Collated lists of acronyms and
abbreviations, best practices, case studies, and figures and tables are
included at the end of this document.</p>

cryosphere and biosphere have occurred. […] Human-induced climate change
is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region
across the globe. Evidence of observed changes in extremes such as
heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical cyclones, and, in
particular, their attribution to human influence, has strengthened since
[the Fifth Assessment Report in 2014]."</p>

<p>It is also clear on the consequences of further inaction <span

<blockquote>
<p>"Global surface temperature will continue to increase until at least

emissions occur in the coming decades. […] Many changes in the climate
system become larger in direct relation to increasing global warming.
They include increases in the frequency and intensity of hot extremes,
marine heatwaves, heavy precipitation, and, in some regions,
agricultural and ecological droughts; an increase in the proportion of
intense tropical cyclones; and reductions in Arctic sea ice, snow cover
and permafrost."</p>

CERN, like other HECAP+ institutions, categorises its emissions by scope
rather than sector, making a direct comparison difficult. Instead, we
can consider total per-capita emissions, dividing CERN’s emissions
equally amongst its seventeen thousand Users (scientists involved in
CERN-based research), to obtain roughly 15 <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{tCO}_2\mathrm{e}\)</span> per researcher
per annum, or twice the global average of 6.3 <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{tCO}_2\mathrm{e}\)</span>. Note that this
does not include personal household emissions for researchers, which may
exceed their workplace emissions. It also incorrectly assigns some
emissions due to CERN’s smaller cohort of direct personnel, e.g.,  due
to CERN-funded travel or personal computing equipment, to its entire
User base. For a fairer accounting, see Figure <a
href="#fig:Intro-ComparativeEmissions" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:Intro-ComparativeEmissions">4</a>. This chart
attributes work-related emissions in each sector to the ‘true’ consumers
of each resource, for researchers at CERN as well as four other
HECAP+ institutions, the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (<span
data-acronym-label="mpia"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">mpia</span>) in Heidelberg, Germany,
the Department of Physics (D-Phys) at <span data-acronym-label="eth"

details of underlying methodology see Appendix <a
href="#sec:DataforFig1.4" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:DataforFig1.4">8</a>. Since many institutional
estimates do not yet fully account for Scope 3 emissions, the numbers in
this chart should be taken as indicative only, and caution should be
employed in making comparisons across institutions on this basis. It is
nevertheless evident that work-related emissions for many of us far
exceed our remaining budget to stay within 1.5C of warming <span
class="citation" data-cites="IPCC2021reportSPM"><sup>1</sup></span>. <a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>These work-related emissions are due to choices we make, as
individuals, collaborations, or institutions. They could be a direct
consequence of HECAP+ research, such as the choice of detector design;
computing setup or software pipeline for simulation and analysis; or how
we collaborate or communicate the results of our work. Alternatively
they could be peripherally related to the science we do: how we commute
between our home and workplace, for example, or the food we consume
whilst at work; or how our offices are powered, heated and ventilated.
Historically, many of these choices have been made prioritising cost or
convenience over environmental and social impact. However, the rapid and
systematic societal change needed to keep to our climate change goals
requires system-wide engagement at all levels of academia. We can impel
positive change throughout the academic system by re-assessing these
choices and how central they are to our primary function as
scientists.</p>

with natural gas <span class="citation"
data-cites="Nikhef"><sup>13</sup></span>. The building is undergoing a
major renovation in 2021–2023, which will remove the need of gas for
heating. Instead, the heat from the nearby data centre will be used, in
addition to better thermal insulation of the building. More generally,
however, renovations of buildings dating from last century quickly pay
off in energy bills and have a positive impact on the climate.</p>
<p>The Nikhef sustainability roadmap <span class="citation"
data-cites="Nikhef"><sup>13</sup></span> covers all sources of direct
and indirect carbon emissions. For instance, by 2030, air travel should
be reduced by 50% and daily commuting should be climate-neutral.
Intermediate targets for 2025 are also set and yearly emissions will be
monitored and reported.</p>

<p>This process has already begun. Universities and other institutions
are including sustainability in buildings planning (see Best Practice <a

Towards Climate Sustainability of the Academic System in Europe and
Beyond</h3>
<p>The All European Academies (<span data-acronym-label="allea"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">allea</span>) Working Group on
Climate Sustainability in the Academic System published a report in May
2022 <span class="citation" data-cites="ALLEA"><sup>25</sup></span>, the
aim of which is "to assess current practices and to critically examine
current and proposed measures." The document urges stakeholders — either
individual (researchers and students) or structural (universities,
funding bodies, conference organisers, ranking agencies, and policy
makers) — to know their roles and responsibilities toward a
climate-sustainable academic system. After summarizing available data on
GHG emissions from various stakeholders and reviewing the current
practices aimed at reducing those emissions, the report outlines
recommendations for individual and group stakeholders. Dimensions of
social justice and equity are among the principles underlying all
recommendations, as well as the opportunity for the academic system to
be a role model in the matter. While all group stakeholders are advised
to embed sustainability in their strategies, individual ones
differ: students and academic members are encouraged to hold university
management accountable, to demand divestment and to generate awareness.
The importance of the development of an evidence base is emphasised,
along with mix-and-match approaches to meeting formats. Finally,
stakeholders are pushed to allocate funding to the decarbonization of
the academic system.</p>
<h3
id="snowmass-contribution-climate-impacts-of-particle-physics">Snowmass
Contribution, Climate Impacts of Particle Physics</h3>
<p>The report "Climate impacts of particle physics" <span
class="citation" data-cites="Bloom:2022gux"><sup>26</sup></span>,
submitted to the proceedings of the US Community Study on the Future of
Particle Physics (Snowmass 2021) focuses on facility construction,
detector gases, computing, and GHG emissions from particle physics
laboratories. The report highlights two key motivations for addressing
the ecological and climate impacts of particle physics: (i) that the
particle physics community has a moral obligation to do so and (ii) that
its professional activities will be under increasing scrutiny from a
number of stakeholders. The latter means that the community will be
under increasing pressure to justify its carbon emissions against its
relative size, compared to other industries, and its societal
benefits.</p>
<p>As a concrete example, the report focuses on the Future Circular
Collider (<span data-acronym-label="fcc"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">fcc</span>) — the proposed 100 TeV
electron-positron (and later hadron) collider. The authors estimate that
the construction of the roughly 100 km circumference tunnel alone would
lead to <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> emissions at
the level of a few hundred kilotons, several times more than other large
US building projects. This corresponds to "per physicist" emissions 80
times larger than their estimated 1.1 <span data-acronym-label="tco2"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">tco2</span> per capita per year limit
needed to keep global warming to less that 1.5C. The authors emphasise
the significant impact of the GHGs used in particle physics detectors
and for cooling, which can have warming potential that exceeds that of
<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> by as much as four
orders of magnitude (in the case of <span class="math inline">\({\rm
SF}_6\)</span>). The report then highlights a number of avenues for
reducing the GHG emissions due to the electricity consumption of
computing, which is pivotal to running and exploiting such facilities.
It also discusses the additional emissions due to collaborative research
activities, with a particular emphasis on taking careful steps to reduce
air travel that capitalise on potential benefits for social justice
while minimising unintended negative consequences for members of the
community.</p>
<p>The report’s recommendations stress the need for reporting on planned
emissions and energy usage for new facilities; standardised reporting of
emissions across the sector, and community-wide engagement to tackle the
negative climate impacts of particle physics research through dedicated
research time.</p>

2020 and 2021, respectively. The documents, which were the result of
proposals from the yHEP community, including HECAP, nuclear and

approach on a broad range of topics, including, but not limited to,
travel, conferences, computing and infrastructure, resource management
and financing, and green energy.</p>
<h2 id="impelling-positive-change">Impelling Positive Change</h2>
<p>The aim of this document is to provide a comprehensive discussion of
the various impacts of HECAP+ research, from our day-to-day activities
through to the large infrastructure projects on which our science
depends. The discussions presented here have much in common with those
of the documents described in Section <a href="#sec:other_initiatives"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:other_initiatives">1.2</a>. This document is,
however, intended to have broad scope and, through case studies and best
practice, to illustrate potential actions that can be implemented at
individual, group and institutional levels to limit the impacts of
HECAP+ research on the world’s climate and ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, if the HECAP+ community is to succeed in improving the
sustainability of its working practices, then the environment and
related issues of social justice must be recognised as integral parts of
the planning and management of our research activities. With this in
mind, we collect below a list of recommendations for structural changes
to the organisation of our community, our training and our professional
development.</p>
<p>These recommendations complement those listed in the discussions of
specific sources of environmental impacts of HECAP+ research on which
the bulk of this document focuses. Together, these provide concrete
suggestions of ways in which the HECAP+ community can act to reduce its
negative climate and ecological impacts, and address issues of social
justice in line with the United Nations Sustainability Goals, discussed
in the next subsection.</p>

<p>As a global research community of people in HECAP+, we have an impact
on society all over the world. We contribute to society’s knowledge with
facts that shape the way the Universe is understood. Furthermore, we
drive innovation and have reliable funding through institutions, which
is being used to employ many individuals and invest in infrastructure.
This makes the institutes of the HECAP+ community a significant factor
in their local economic systems. They provide jobs and are often
purchasers of goods and services. This economic activity gives us
leverage to demand that improvements to social and environmental
standards be put in effect.</p>
<p>We also have a responsibility towards society to advance the
sustainable development of the world. This is why we, the
HECAP+ community, support the UN SDGs (see Figure <a
href="#fig:17_UN_SustGoals" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:17_UN_SustGoals">5</a>). The topics discussed in
this document are meant to support a multiplicity of these goals, and we
aim to identify the influence of our work in all aspects. We have a
higher impact on some goals than on others, and further work to quantify
these impacts and the steps that the HECAP+ community can take to limit
and ideally remove them require dedicated, on-going research beyond the
scope of this document.</p>
<p>The Sustainable Development Goals are defined in UN resolution

<p>Computing, used for theoretical modelling, simulation, and data
analysis, represents an integral part of basic research. With increasing
data sets and demands for accuracy, computing resource consumption is
expected to rise. This poses concerns in the context of climate
sustainability. Within HECAP+, for example, the High-Luminosity phase of
the Large Hadron Collider (<span data-acronym-label="hl-lhc"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">hl-lhc</span>), predicted to be
operational from 2026, is expected to rely on 50 to 100 times the

with data storage requirements reaching exabytes <span class="citation"

time, some lattice quantum chromodynamics (<span

calculations, applied, e.g., to studying heavy quark decays and
anomalous magnetic moments, can be too expensive to pursue, even if

centralised computing centres that <span>—</span> depending on the
application <span>—</span> deal with large volumes of experimental data.
As an international community, we also rely on communication
technologies and the ability to move these large volumes of data around
the globe. The infrastructure we use to do so, comprising hardware, the
data centres within which the hardware is housed, and cloud computing
resources used for data storage, contributes to our community’s energy
consumption and the waste that our research generates. Furthermore, the
energy efficiency of hardware is ultimately limited by the efficiency of
the computer programmes that run on this hardware, making the GHG
emissions of HECAP+ researchers dependent upon the choice of software
architecture.</p>

<h2 id="subsec:hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p>When considering the future of sustainability in HECAP+, the hardware
aspect of computing is of great concern. Hardware is both energy- and
resource-consuming. The manufacture, transport, energy consumption, and
disposal of each piece of hardware contribute substantially to the
environmental footprint of HPC that HECAP+ relies on to analyse large
swathes of data.</p>
<p>Manufacture is the largest source of hardware <span
data-acronym-label="ghg" data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">ghg</span>
emissions, with primarily fossil-fuel-powered manufacturing chains
contributing as much as 80–85% of lifetime emissions of a personal
computing device <span class="citation"
data-cites="Greenpeace_Oeko OxfordLCA"><sup>33,34</sup></span>.
Moreover, production is notoriously resource-intensive <span
class="citation" data-cites="Greenpeace_Oeko"><sup>33</sup></span>, with
the mining of the necessary metals and ‘conflict’ minerals responsible
for a number of negative environmental and social effects. Improper
disposal of substances found in computing equipment are also linked to
environmental hazards and a variety of other risks. For an in-depth
discussion, see Section <a href="#sec:Waste" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:Waste">7</a>.</p>
<p>One way to mitigate the impact due to production is by purchasing
modular equipment, which allows for easy upgrades and repurposing of
hardware. In fact, the extension of hardware lifetime has been
increasingly demonstrated to have major benefits over upgrading to more
efficient technology. A study by the University of Edinburgh Department
for Social Responsibility and Sustainability <span class="citation"
data-cites="UniEd"><sup>35</sup></span> found that simply using 174
computer monitors for six years instead of four saved 33 <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{tCO}_2\mathrm{e}\)</span>, which, when
incorporated into standard practice, would not only reduce purchasing
costs, but would result in an annual GHG savings of 380 <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{tCO}_2\mathrm{e}\)</span>. It is also
crucial that institutions be able and willing to support repairs. This
applies in particular to personal equipment, e.g., laptops, which come
with additional peripherals such as display, keyboard, and housing, as
compared with HPC units in data centres.</p>
<p>Furthermore, prioritising suppliers that implement sustainable
sourcing, including recovery of secondary materials, and manufacturing
methods would partially mitigate the resource burden, as would enabling
circularity and appropriate E-waste recycling. As one example, TCO
certification<span class="citation"
data-cites="TCO_Certified"><sup>36</sup></span> is the world-leading
sustainability certification for IT products, such as those supplied by
Lenovo, Dell, or Acer. TCO-certified compliance is independently
verified both pre- and post-certification. TCO certification also covers
data centre products, which could be given preference over uncertified
ones for cluster computing. For more information on sustainable
procurement, including some hallmarks of sustainability in raw materials
supply chains, see Section <a href="#subsec:Resources"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="subsec:Resources">7.1</a>. For
further discussion of E-waste, see Section <a href="#subsec:Waste"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="subsec:Waste">7.2</a>.</p>
<p>A secondary source of hardware emissions is energy consumption during
its use, with the majority coming from processors, memory, and runtime
of jobs. Processor upgrades and the optimisation of memory type can
greatly reduce energy consumption.</p>
<p>It is important to ensure ‘energy proportionality’ in hardware use,
i.e.,  that energy consumption is proportional to computing performance
over the full range of applications<span class="citation"
data-cites="energy-prop-computing"><sup>37</sup></span>. Often, hardware
designed to be most efficient at maximum performance load in practice
spends most of its time idle, or performing less intensive computations.
This can be addressed by e.g.,  running jobs at high utilization rate on
as few servers as possible.</p>
<p>Implementing parallelisation within processors can also reduce the
number of processors needed, and by replacing central processing units
(CPUs) with graphics processing units (GPUs), the energy usage can be
reduced. For certain tasks relevant to HECAP+ applications, other even
more specialised processors are available, such as Google’s tensor
processing unit (TPU) <span class="citation"
data-cites="Tensor"><sup>38</sup></span>. This consumes less power than
its predecessors, although it suffers from poor energy proportionality:
at 10% load, it consumes almost 90% of the power it would consume at
100% load<span class="citation"
data-cites="TensorPerformance"><sup>39</sup></span>. However, it should
always be tested whether parallelisation does reduce the overall energy
usage of a task, as an increase in energy consumption per second could
counteract the benefits of reduced runtime. Another aspect to take into
consideration when implementing parallelisation is the particular
application, and its requirements in terms of memory, scalability, and
data access. Reference <span class="citation"
data-cites="Abdurachmanov:2014xka"><sup>40</sup></span> discusses these
issues in the context of the Worldwide Large Hadron Collider Computing
Grid (WLCG). It also gives suggestions for power-aware software
applications and scheduling that could reduce power consumption. Some of
the advocated changes are software specific and are further detailed in
Section <a href="#subsec:software" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="subsec:software">2.2</a>. The Green500 list <span
class="citation" data-cites="GreenList"><sup>41</sup></span> ranks the
most energy efficient high-performance computing systems. The GHG
emissions of the computer centres which house them, however, depend
critically on their infrastructure. This aspect is further discussed
in Section <a href="#subsec:infrastructure" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="subsec:infrastructure">2.3</a>.</p>
<h2 id="subsec:software">Software</h2>
<p>Software is integral to the work of HECAP+. It underpins how the
global HECAP+ community communicates, shares data, produces papers and
graphics, and acquires, manages, processes and analyses huge amounts of
data from experiments, observatories and simulations.</p>
<p>It is therefore pivotal that the software developed and used by the
HECAP+ community is efficient in order to minimise CPU hours, and to
facilitate data sharing and long-term reproducibility. This requires a
balance to be struck between portability and optimisation for particular
architectures. While not directly linked to environmental
sustainability, initiatives focused on software sustainability in
HECAP+, such as the <span data-acronym-label="iris-hep"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">iris-hep</span> <span
class="citation" data-cites="IRISHEP"><sup>42</sup></span> and the <span
data-acronym-label="hep" data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">hep</span>
Software Foundation <span class="citation"
data-cites="HSF"><sup>43</sup></span>, may provide an important platform
for accelerating the inclusion of environmental considerations in
software development. Doing so is compatible with the <span
data-acronym-label="fair" data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">fair</span>
principles <span class="citation" data-cites="FAIR"><sup>44</sup></span>
for scientific data management, that software (and data) should be
Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable.</p>
<p>Much of the code used in HECAP+ computing relies on libraries and
public codes. Experiments use general frameworks and software
infrastructure provided by experts in the experiments. They can have a
tremendous impact on the energy efficiency of the employed code and, in
some cases, work to meet strict requirements posed by the computing
environment. Decisions on the computing language employed can be
crucial, with Fortran and C++ specifically suited for numerical
calculations, whilst others prioritise convenience or readability over
performance. Changes in processor architecture have been utilised
through dedicated and collaborative efforts, leading to a factor of 2
improvement in the performance (and energy efficiency) of the
reconstruction code of the <span data-acronym-label="atlas"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">atlas</span> experiment <span
class="citation"
data-cites="ATL-SOFT-PUB-2021-002"><sup>45</sup></span>. Other examples
of software improvement are recent improvements in a MC generator core
code, having led to an improvement in speed of a factor of 50 (see Case
Study <a href="#CS:SoftwareOptimisation" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="CS:SoftwareOptimisation">[CS:SoftwareOptimisation]</a>).
In the case of cosmological analyses, it has been suggested that the
Likelihood Inference Neural Network Accelerator (LINNA) can lead to
efficiency increases that would save $300,000 in energy costs and around
2,200 <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{tCO}_2\)</span> in first-year
Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)
analyses <span class="citation"
data-cites="To:2022ubu"><sup>46</sup></span>.</p>
<p>Sustainable use of software can also be encouraged at an individual
level. The energy used in a job directly correlates with the memory
assigned/available for a job, so mitigation by individuals can be easily
implemented through assigning the correct memory used and by optimising
code <span class="citation" data-cites="Karayakin"><sup>47</sup></span>.
Further examples of conscientious use of software include limiting
resolution or precision to that which is necessary, effective testing to
avoid wasted CPU hours, good practice in data retention to avoid data
loss and the need to rerun analysis or simulations, and scheduling CPU
hours when a higher percentage of the local energy mix is from
renewables.</p>

energy) saving, paving the way towards affordable and sustainable
state-of-the-art event simulation in the HL-LHC era.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="subsec:infrastructure">Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Even the most energy-efficient data centres are not environmentally
sustainable if they are powered by carbon-based fuels <span
class="citation" data-cites="Bloom:2022gux"><sup>26</sup></span>.
However, provided energy from renewable sources is available, this can
be easily addressed. Indeed, there are many advantages to doing so,
owing to the flexibility of HTC. Inherent fluctuations in supply of
electricity from renewables can be managed using a smart queueing system
that runs jobs at times where electricity has a large renewable
component, or directs them to data centres where this is the case.
Moreover, a carefully-managed HTC system can even help stabilise
fully-renewable power grids in response to local imbalances in supply
and demand: an instantaneous reduction in the CPU clock frequency by up
to 60% ensures per-second grid stabilisation, and a similar technique
can be employed on longer time scales, e.g.,  hourly, in response to
changes in the carbon intensity of electricity (or equivalently, market
price). For longer periods, with higher latency, this can also involve
powering down nodes. The reduced work can be compensated by operating
older hardware longer, but only when the electricity price is low. See
Section <a href="#sec:Ene-Transition" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:Ene-Transition">3.1</a> for further discussion of
renewables-based grid infrastructure.</p>
<p>Another source of GHG emissions associated with computing is the
construction and operation of the large data centres within which IT
equipment is housed. Although emissions due to construction can be
significant, particularly if concrete is used, our focus in the
remainder of the section will be on cooling the facilities and
equipment, which is responsible, on average, for almost one third of
facility power use. A judicious choice of location for the centre can
minimise these energy costs, by provision of a cooler external
environment, or other means to cool efficiently. Proximity to a large
body of water, for example, could make water cooling an attractive
option. Care must be taken, however, to ensure minimal disruption to the
natural environment. Waste heat from the data centre can also be reused
to heat nearby infrastructure. For examples of best practice in data
centre design and construction, see Best Practice <a href="#BP:CSCS"

full load, with a design PUE of 1.25.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> At CSCS, high-efficiency
cooling is achieved with a state-of-the art cooling system using the
water from Lake Lugano, extracted at a depth of 45 m and a temperature
of 6C. 420 litres of this water per second are pumped to the facility
over a distance of 2.8 km into large heat exchangers, where it meets and
cools the water in the internal cooling circuit for the supercomputers.
The resulting warmer water is then sent to a heat exchanger in a second
cooling circuit, which cools the components with a lower thermal
sensitivity, as well as the building itself in the summer, before being
returned to the lake. The return flow of water falling back into the
lake is used to produce electricity via a microturbine in the pumping
station further reducing the power consumption of the pumps by 30%. Due
to modular cooling and room concepts, the different parts of the
facility are equipped only as necessary. Not only does this reduce the
initial budgetary outlay, but it also results in increased flexibility
to react to future hardware needs, while keeping the PUE close to its
final design value from the outset.</p>

to upgrade the IT capacity in two steps to 8 MW and finally to 12 MW. A
Call for Tender was initiated at the end of 2019 for the design,
construction and 10 year operation and maintenance of a new <span
data-acronym-label="dc" data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">dc</span> and
the result of the tender was adjudicated at the CERN Finance Committee
in December 2020 in favour of a consortium led by EQUANS <span
class="citation" data-cites="EQUANS"><sup>53</sup></span>. A contract
was signed with the winning consortium in July 2021 and construction
began at the beginning of 2022. The DC is expected to be operational in
the final quarter of 2023. An important aspect included in the thinking
for the new DC was sustainability and, in particular, energy efficiency.
As such, the specification required a target Power Usage Effectiveness
(<span data-acronym-label="pue"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">pue</span>) of 1.1, but contractually
allows for a <span data-acronym-label="pue"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">pue</span> of no worse than 1.15, for
energy recuperation of at least 25% of the heat generated by the IT
equipment and for a roof with vegetation.</p>
<p>When considering the increased energy efficiency compared with CERN’s
existing Meyrin Data Centre, which now has a PUE of around 1.5 after
many years of efforts to bring this down, this equates to significant
energy savings. Assuming the PCC running at full first phase capacity of
4 MW with a PUE of 1.1, cf. 1.5 for the current CERN Data Centre, then
the annual saving in terms of electricity would be 14 GWh. Obviously,
should the PCC be eventually upgraded and used at its full final
capacity then the savings could be tripled, cf. with running a similar
capacity with the PUE of the current Meyrin Data Centre. It should be
noted that the PUE of the current Data Centre is the result of many
years of efforts to improve the energy efficiency, which have
substantially reduced its PUE, but that further improvements would now
be complex and costly.</p>
<p>In addition to aiming for high energy efficiency, the design of the
PCC also allows for the heat produced by the IT equipment to be
recuperated and used to help power a new building heating plant that
will soon be built close to the PCC to replace an existing ageing and
inefficient heating plant. The specification for the PCC required the
possibility to recover a minimum of 25% of the generated heat per phase,
implying 1.3 MW per phase leading to a total of 3 MW once the full 12 MW
configuration would be operational. However, during the design phase it
has been decided to request 3 MW already during the first phase. In the
second phase, the heat recuperation will be increased to 4 MW.</p>
<p>During hot weather, water is sprayed on the heat exchanger elements
of the dry coolers to improve their efficiency. In the original design,
this water was lost, resulting in a non-insignificant water consumption
over the year. However, with sustainability and environmental protection
considerations in mind, it was decided to make efforts to reduce the
water consumption as far as possible without impacting the efficiency of
the cooling solution. As such, it was agreed with the contractor to
change the design to include water re-circulation at the level of the
dry coolers and hence substantially to reduce the water consumption. In
the first phase, the annual water consumption is estimated to be reduced
by 61% from 21,455 <span class="math inline">\({\rm m}^3\)</span> to
8,645 <span class="math inline">\({\rm m}^3\)</span>, based on the
average meteorological data for the area.</p>
<p>To further improve sustainability and to make the building more
ecologically friendly, it was also decided to request that vegetation be
planted on the roof of the building, which is effectively in two halves.
The first half contains the IT rooms (two per floor for three floors)
and the second half is for all the technical rooms. The roof is
similarly split in two. The first half is used for the dry coolers and
associated technical infrastructure and hence cannot be used for
vegetation, but the second half will be planted with grass covering an
area of approximately 1,250 <span class="math inline">\({\rm
m}^2\)</span>.</p>

<p>This became possible due to the award-winning innovative design of
the Green-IT Cube, which was developed at the Frankfurt Institute of

water cooled back-door heat exchangers allowed not only for a low PUE,
but also for an advanced 3D building design which reduced the ground

building material needed, further reducing the environmental impact.
Parts of the excess heat are used to heat office buildings on the GSI

<p>The operation of experimental equipment and computing facilities at
large-scale research centres means that they have a significant energy
footprint. In addition, energy is required for the construction and
disassembly of infrastructure, for heating and cooling buildings,and for
transport of goods. To comply with the Paris Agreement, future
facilities must be effectively climate-neutral, and this presents a
significant challenge for HECAP+.</p>
<p>Particle collider experiments are particularly power-hungry, with the
<span data-acronym-label="lhc"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">lhc</span> at <span
data-acronym-label="cern" data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">cern</span>
being a prominent example. With its particle accelerators, detectors and
extensive infrastructure, CERN consumes up to 1,300 GWh of electricity
annually, of which 55% is due to LHC operations <span class="citation"
data-cites="Environment:2737239 CERNenergymanagement"><sup>9,56</sup></span>.
CERN plans to significantly increase the scale of its installations in a
push to higher energies and intensities. Doing so responsibly will
require a concerted effort to minimise power consumption and increase
the energy efficiency of the infrastructure, and a careful analysis of
how to source the remaining energy needs in a sustainable way.</p>
<p>CERN receives most of its electricity from the French grid, which is
currently characterised by a high share of low-carbon nuclear power,
suppressing its electricity-related <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> emissions in comparison
with other facilities (see Figure <a

data-reference="fig:Intro-ComparativeEmissions">4</a>).<a href="#fn10"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>
However, taking into consideration the decreasing share of nuclear power
in the French grid over the last 15 years, as well as the wider common
European electricity market, where fossil fuels account for 37% of
electricity production on average <span class="citation"
data-cites="BPReport"><sup>57</sup></span>, the outlook is more
worrying.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>It is important to place the energy needs of HECAP+ research
infrastructure within the context of the world’s necessary and rapid
transition to zero-carbon energy sources. Global primary energy
consumption in 2019 was approximately 160,000 TWh (equivalent to an
average power consumption of 18,000 GW), around 80% of which comes from
<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span>-emitting fossil
fuels <span class="citation" data-cites="OWDfuels"><sup>59</sup></span>.
Moreover, demand is rising, primarily due to the growth and
industrialisation of emerging countries. A 50% reduction of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> emissions by 2030, as
stipulated in the Paris Agreement in combination with the latest IPCC
scenarios (see Fig. <a href="#fig:ene-netco2" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:ene-netco2">1</a>), will create a huge global energy

<p>Many experimental technologies such as <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> sequestration will not be
viable for large-scale implementation within this short time frame.
Filling the energy gap with solar, wind, and nuclear power requires
upscaling existing facilities by more than an order of magnitude within
seven years, a not inconsiderable task. Therefore, substantial energy
savings and efficiency increase will be indispensable. Even tripling the
output of existing solar, wind and nuclear installations by 2030 (which
might itself be unrealistic), the fossil energy gap would still require
a 40% global efficiency increase compared to today. Substantial savings
in energy require systemic changes in technology and behaviour, such as
transitioning from combustion engines to electric motors, from gas
heating to heat pumps, from cars to rail, and from lightbulbs to LEDs.
The global situation is therefore likely to result in energy becoming
scarce and expensive in the coming decades, with the potential to
directly limit our capabilities to conduct energy-intensive experiments
and data analysis in basic research.</p>

<h2 id="sec:Ene-Transition">Low-Carbon Energy</h2>
<p>Transitioning the energy demands of HECAP+ research to <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span>-neutral sources will likely
require a mix of sources: solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and nuclear
power, many of which will be strongly location-dependent. Despite their
relatively low cost (see Figure <a href="#fig:ene-mitigation"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:ene-mitigation">7</a>),
the geographical and geological limitations of renewable energy,
combined with the challenge that significantly increasing the share of
nuclear power presents (see Case Study <a href="#cs:nuclear_gap"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="cs:nuclear_gap">[cs:nuclear_gap]</a> for details), make
a rapid transition to carbon-neutral energy impossible for
HECAP+ without some large-scale transmission, or import and export of
sustainable energy. World-leading research centres like CERN, with their
history of cooperation across political and ideological boundaries, are
uniquely placed to adopt such an approach. Alternatively, efforts could
be made to site future facilities near abundant sources of renewable
energy, which could have the additional benefit of contributing to the
local economy over a longer period.</p>

<h4 id="solar">Solar</h4>
<p>Solar energy is abundant, and near-universally available. Its
intensity depends on latitude, with the highest efficiencies in the
deserts of the sun belts north and south of the equator. According to a
2021 report by the Carbon Tracker Initiative <span class="citation"
data-cites="CarbonTracker21"><sup>68</sup></span>, populating an area of
only 450,000 km<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span> with solar panels
would be sufficient to satisfy global energy demands. This corresponds
to an area the size of Morocco, two-thirds that of Texas, or 4% of
European landmass. <a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> According to the IPCC <span
class="citation" data-cites="IPCCMitigationReport"><sup>67</sup></span>,
“The global technical potential of direct solar energy far exceeds that
of any other renewable energy resource and is well beyond the total
amount of energy needed to support ambitious mitigation over the current
century.”</p>
<p>Solar panels are also easily retrofitted onto existing
infrastructure, and their price has dropped by almost 90% in the last
two decades. Unfortunately, solar power can be unavailable when it is
needed most: at night and during winter (in countries at higher
latitudes), leading to a need to increase its efficiency and storage
capacity (see “Energy storage” below). See Case Study <a
href="#case:solar" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="case:solar">[case:solar]</a> for a study of the
implementation of in-house solar power at CERN.</p>
<h4 id="wind">Wind</h4>
<p>By comparison with solar energy, wind energy is more sensitive to
local conditions. In Europe, competitive locations for wind energy, with
costs below per kWh, are primarily offshore, and are concentrated along
the coasts of the North and Baltic Seas, the Bay of Biscay, and the
English Channel  <span class="citation"
data-cites="EEAWindEnergy"><sup>69</sup></span>. Landlocked countries,
such as Switzerland or Austria, are generally less suited for production
of energy through wind turbines. In Switzerland, e.g.,  populating 100%
of agricultural farmland with wind farms would only produce 25% of its
energy demand. Similar measures in Denmark or Estonia would lead to a
wind energy output of less than 4% of demand <span class="citation"
data-cites="EEAWindEnergy"><sup>69</sup></span>.</p>
<h4 id="hydro">Hydro</h4>
<p>Water power is even more reliant on local conditions, such as high
flows or water volumes and large altitude difference, which naturally
limits its applicability. However, the energy output of hydroelectric
plants is steady, and can be adjusted to demand very quickly, making it
a good complement to other renewable sources. It can also be used for
energy storage, see “Energy Storage”. The largest hydroelectric capacity
is in China, which produces almost 30% of the global hydroelectric
power <span class="citation" data-cites="IHA2021"><sup>70</sup></span>,
thanks to its large projects in the Yangtze River valleys.</p>
<p>Mega-dams, however, constitute a large intervention on the natural
environment, and consequently come with associated risks such as
landslides, earthquakes, and destruction of habitats, and can themselves
be a source of the potent climate gas methane when flooded flora rots.
The Three Gorges dam in particular has been controversial both
domestically and abroad <span class="citation"
data-cites="ThreeGorges"><sup>71</sup></span>. In arid areas, or during
periods of drought, which are expected to become more prevalent due to
climate change, hydroelectric power may be in competition with
agricultural needs, and climate change may jeopardize future yields of
existing dams.</p>
<p>While the potential for marine power generation from ocean currents,
tides, waves, and gradients in salt and temperature (collectively known
as Ocean Energy Technologies) is huge, there is no technology currently
mature enough to produce marine power at large scale <span
class="citation" data-cites="OET"><sup>72</sup></span>.</p>
<h4 id="geothermal">Geothermal</h4>
<p>Geothermal energy is a stable source of renewable energy. It consists
of residual heat from the time when the Earth was formed and of heat
newly produced inside the Earth due to radioactive decay of hot elements
in the mantle, by tidal forces of moon and sun, or by friction along
tectonic plate boundaries. Although it has low intensity compared with
solar energy, its technical potential of about <span
class="math inline">\(1.4 \times10^6\)</span> TW-years, is around three
times total global energy consumption <span class="citation"
data-cites="Britannica"><sup>73</sup></span>.</p>
<p>The most easily exploitable is the ‘shallow’ geothermal energy stored
in the upper few metres of the Earth’s surface. This can be employed to
provide space heating or cooling for buildings and urban areas using
buried pipes containing a circulating fluid as heat exchanger, and a
geothermal heat pump <span class="citation"
data-cites="Narsilio2018"><sup>74</sup></span>. The low thermal
conductivity of the ground limits the total amount of geothermal heat
that can be exploited and depends strongly on rain and ground water.
Modern geothermal heat pumps use the ground as heat storage and not so
much as heat source. The ground heat that is extracted in winter is
regenerated in summer by using the heat pump for cooling the
building.</p>
<p>Geothermal power generation, however, requires higher temperatures.
Easily accessed only in areas of volcanic activity, and along plate
boundaries, much geothermal power-generating potential is locked up
below common drilling depths, where the rock is less porous. Enhanced
Geothermal Systems (<span data-acronym-label="egs"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">egs</span>) <span class="citation"
data-cites="IRENA2017"><sup>75</sup></span>, in which porosity is
induced by fracturing deeper, hotter rock using high-pressure water
injection, to allow for fluid circulation. This hydrothermal ‘fracking’
has attracted significant controversy as in addition to the injection of
toxic chemicals into the Earth, which can then pollute nearby
groundwater sources, it brings a risk of induced seismic activity if
unwittingly carried out near a ‘locked’ dormant fault, and was thought
to be responsible for triggering a magnitude-5.4 earthquake in the South
Korean city of Pohang in November 2017 <span class="citation"
data-cites="Kim2018 Grigoli2018"><sup>76,77</sup></span>.</p>
<h4 id="nuclear">Nuclear</h4>
<p>Nuclear power production has been stagnating on all continents except
Asia for the last two decades, and has a share of just 4% of the global
energy production, more than 60 years after initial deployment <span
class="citation" data-cites="OWDnuclear"><sup>78</sup></span>. According
to the International Atomic Energy Agency (<span
data-acronym-label="iaea"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">iaea</span>), nuclear reactors have a
median construction time of 93 months <span class="citation"
data-cites="IAEANuclear"><sup>79</sup></span>, not including planning
and permissions. See Case Study <a href="#cs:nuclear_gap"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="cs:nuclear_gap">[cs:nuclear_gap]</a> below for an
estimate of how many nuclear power stations one would need to construct
in order to cover global energy needs.</p>
<p>By definition, an energy source is only sustainable if it does not
carry any significant long-term risk for future generations. This
understanding of sustainability based on the Brundlandt Report <span
class="citation" data-cites="Brundtland"><sup>80</sup></span> has also
been adopted by the <span data-acronym-label="iaea"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">iaea</span> <span class="citation"
data-cites="IAEA"><sup>81</sup></span>, which argues for the ‘weak
sustainability’ of nuclear power.</p>
<p>Safety, security and climate resilience of the reactors, and
availability of fuel, as well as storage of spent fuel, are important
factors. The exact form these concerns take is crucially dependent on
future technological developments, to which HECAP+ research contributes
directly. Today, several new reactor types are being developed, which
promise to have additional safety features, an efficient use of more
abundant isotopes and less long-lasting nuclear waste. Bringing nascent
technologies to maturity and commercial viability takes time, and in the
near term the IPCC does not assess favourably the mitigation potential
for nuclear energy, see Figure <a href="#fig:ene-mitigation"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:ene-mitigation">7</a>.
Moreover wars, terrorism and proliferation will always remain a
concern.</p>
<h4 id="renewable-power-grids">Renewable power grids</h4>
<p>For global power grids to rely more heavily on intermittent sources
of renewable energy, such as wind and solar photovoltaic (<span
data-acronym-label="pv" data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">pv</span>),
assessed as having the highest climate mitigation potential to 2030 by
the IPCC (see Figure <a href="#fig:ene-mitigation"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:ene-mitigation">7</a>),
much of the existing grid infrastructure and controls will need to be
updated to smooth out fluctuations in supply and demand. Grid inertia,
which acts as a short-term buffer in fossil-fuel grids in periods where
electricity demand outstrips supply, is significantly lower for
intermittent sources, compromising the stability of the grid. ’Smart
grid’ infrastructure must provide peak-shifting capabilities and fast
frequency response to stabilise electricity supply despite the lower
intrinsic inertia of the grid. It will also need to draw upon a novel
and expanded energy storage capacity to bridge longer-term gaps between
supply and demand (for further discussion, see below), as well as the
capability to regulate bi-directional flow of electricity, well-suited
to the distributed generation of intermittents. Inverter-based resources
with low inertia are ideally suited to near-instantaneous response.
Electronic control of this response, coupled with developing
’grid-forming’ technologies, which allow inverters to emulate a
traditional grid’s stable frequency, as well as automated demand-side
response to voluntarily disconnect non-critical loads momentarily, have
the potential to transform our existing networks <span class="citation"
data-cites="PowerGridInertia"><sup>82</sup></span>.</p>
<p>Existing solutions have been utilized successfully in several
fully-renewable island microgrids, and on a larger scale in the Electric
Reliability Council of Texas (<span data-acronym-label="ercot"

three power grids in the United States, which achieved 58% instantaneous
wind penetration in 2019<span class="citation"
data-cites="PowerGridInertia"><sup>82</sup></span>. Scaling up these
solutions requires further research, although several highly-cited
studies argue for the feasibility of 100% renewable-based grids
world-wide at low cost, eschewing any fossil fuel or nuclear energy

<h4 id="energy-storage">Energy storage</h4>
<p>The feasibility of pure renewable-based grids is crucially dependent
on an increased energy storage capacity, to smooth out fluctuations (on
timescales ranging from diurnal to seasonal) in the supply of
intermittent renewables, and demand. While the cost of Li-ion batteries
have plummeted 40-fold in the past 35 years <span class="citation"
data-cites="Ziegler_2020"><sup>85</sup></span>, their development,
driven by needs of the electric vehicle industry, has focused on
short-duration portable energy storage. Projections show that in order
to minimize the costs of a net-zero energy system, storage capacity must
increase by almost an order of magnitude, from 160 GW (and 9 TWh total
capacity) today, to 1.5-2.5 TW (85-140 TWh) globally by 2040 <span
class="citation"
data-cites="LDESEnergyStorage"><sup>86</sup></span>.</p>
<p>Most existing and planned storage capacity is in pumped storage
hydropower, a mechanical form of storage where water pumped into a
reservoir at high elevation turns a turbine as it flows to one at lower
elevation. As well as being geographically limited however, these
open-air reservoirs are plagued by environmental problems and subject to
the vagaries of the climate. A new promising approach to pump storage is
the use of undersea bowls that are evacuated to store energy which is
restored when they are filled up with water again. An even simpler
approach is to build a large ring wall inside of a deep lake and empty
and refill the internal area using pump-turbines. This way,
pumped-storage hydroelectricity does not require a separate upper and
lower lake, and a single lake is sufficient. Defunct open pit mines,
large natural lakes and even the sea allow for new opportunities to
install large-scale storage devices with less environmental impact <span
class="citation"
data-cites="Dueren pumpstorage"><sup>87,88</sup></span>.</p>
<p>Interesting alternatives include storing energy as compressed air; or
as latent heat in, e.g., aluminium alloy. However, there is need for
significant investment in the energy storage sector to bring new ideas,
including novel mechanical, thermal, electrochemical and chemical
storage methods to commercial viability <span class="citation"
data-cites="LDESEnergyStorage"><sup>86</sup></span>. For more details on
capacity and market-readiness of promising long-duration energy storage
methods, see Ref. <span class="citation"

<h4 id="energy-import-and-export">Energy import and export</h4>
<p>The uneven geographical distribution of sources of renewable energy
naturally begs the question of whether large-scale import and export of
renewable energy could be a cost-effective way of closing the energy
gap. For Europe, detailed studies have shown that energy import by cable
as well as by chemical energy carriers have comparable or lower costs
compared to local energy harvesting <span class="citation"
data-cites="10.1371/journal.pone.0281380"><sup>89</sup></span>.</p>
<p>Technical options to transport electricity over long distances have
improved significantly in the last decades. In South America and China,
projects to transport electricity over more than 2,000 km by Ultra High
Voltage Direct Current (<span data-acronym-label="uhvdc"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">uhvdc</span>) lines are already
operational <span class="citation"
data-cites="Champion"><sup>90</sup></span>.</p>
<p>This technological progress opens up an alternative to the
traditional import and export of chemical energy: direct import of
renewable electricity, e.g., from Northern Africa to Europe <span
class="citation"
data-cites="Dueren Dueren+2011+263+275"><sup>87,91</sup></span>. Indeed,
the Xlinks Morocco-UK Power Project <span class="citation"
data-cites="Xlinks"><sup>92</sup></span> aims to connect a solar and
wind energy facility in Morocco’s Guelmim Oued Noun region to the UK
energy grid by 3,800 km HVDC sub-sea cables by 2030.</p>
<p>An excellent potential for electricity generation by solar and wind
power, large unused tracts of land, and existing energy trade
partnerships for fossil fuels make North African countries ideal export
partners for procuring electricity from sustainable sources. HECAP+ has
a record of successful collaboration between nations and could thus be
an important player in making this happen. Hence, importing and
exporting renewable energy should be considered as part of a catalogue
of solutions to cover our future energy needs. One possible scenario for
the transmission of solar energy is detailed in the Case Study <a
href="#case:desert" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="case:desert">[case:desert]</a> below.</p>
<p>While the import and export of energy is a promising solution on the
technical and economic level, constructing wind or solar farms, e.g., in
the sun belts of Africa, to then export the power to Europe involves
geopolitical and social considerations. Resource and person-power
extraction from Africa to the benefit of Europe and America has a long,
reprehensible colonial history. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to
make fair power trade agreements between the continents that ensure
strong integration into local communities and include the local
population in the planning and implementation of such projects and
related infrastructure. In this way, a win-win situation for all
stakeholders should be ensured, and well-planned cooperation has the
potential to act in a geopolitically stabilizing way in line with the
16th and 17th UN SDGs ("peace, justice and strong institutions" and
"partnership for the goals").</p>

The HECAP+ community, CERN in particular, has a long history of

CERN ideally placed to spearhead a project to import solar energy from

<div class="center">
<p><img  src="Sections/Figs/Energy/ene-cernlink.jpeg"  /></p>

<p>A scenario for connecting, e.g., Morocco, Algeria or Tunisia to
Southern France, Spain or Italy by sub-sea cable is plausible from a
technological point of view (for a detailed feasibility study, see
Ref. <span class="citation"

for HECAP+ applications (see Figure <a href="#fig:ene-cernlink"

data-cites="Dueren Dueren+2011+263+275 Hampp"><sup>87,91,99</sup></span>.
This estimate includes infrastructure costs for generating the

<p>Electricity imports on this scale would exceed the power needs of
CERN, and surplus power could be returned to the European electricity

<h2 id="sec:Ene-Saving">Energy Saving and Recuperation</h2>
<p>A first step in reducing energy usage is energy monitoring, which
will allow us to assess where we need to implement improvements. The
best energy saving measures will be individual to each location and
facility, making it hard to recommend specific actions here. While
insulating buildings, and ensuring that the heating/ cooling systems are
maximally efficient are universally applicable measures, these are often
the direct purview of the institution, and difficult to influence
directly.</p>
<p>The lion’s share of energy budget for many high energy experiments is
due to the accelerators and detectors. Initiatives to reduce their
energy use are many and varied, relevant references for detectors are
collected in Section <a href="#sec:Technology" data-reference-type="ref"

emphasised that their equitable implementation will require
cross-disciplinary analysis of the implications of such changes for all

The conference Women in Physics 2019 <span class="citation"
data-cites="WIPC"><sup>133</sup></span> at McGill University in Montréal
was designed as a ‘sustainable’ conference. Ecologically-friendly
choices were made by offering purely plant-based catering, sustainable
goodie bags, and use of reusable tableware. Most of the feedback
regarding these measures was positive. An important point for the
organisers was to advertise the catering as sustainable, and not only as
vegan, since according to their experience this “helped the way the
catering was received” by the participants. The organisers mentioned
that it can be difficult to find a vegan caterer if the only choices are
partners of the university hosting the conference, but it was
nevertheless possible in their case.<br />
The ‘Young Researchers Integrability School and Workshop (YRISW) 2019: A
modern primer for 2D CFT’ <span class="citation"
data-cites="YRISW"><sup>134</sup></span> in Vienna offered only
plant-based catering. The organizers of the school selected this option
as the “most inclusive approach”, where people are not separated
according to their eating habits. They wanted to advertise plant-based
food to the participants, and "reduce the environmental impact of the
event". The limited food options also reduced the total cost of the
catering. The organisers received positive feedback, not only for the
food itself but also for the “effort to reduce the ecological impact of
the school". The organizers emphasised the importance of finding a
specialist plant-based caterer to ensure the quality and flavour of the
food.</p>

<p>Mobility constitutes a significant portion of the emissions of a
HECAP+ researcher. This includes short daily commutes between the home
and the workplace and longer-distance business travel (see Figure <a
href="#fig:Intro-ComparativeEmissions" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:Intro-ComparativeEmissions">4</a>).</p>
<p>Transport accounted for almost a fifth of total global emissions in
2016 <span class="citation"
data-cites="OWIDsector"><sup>135</sup></span>, and is the sector that
saw the highest growth in pre-COVID years. Demand for car, rail, and air
transport is expected to continue to increase over time with increasing
global population and income levels.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, self-powered mobility, such as walking and cycling,
are the most carbon-efficient means of transportation, with train travel
next best. A quantitative comparison between these and other options
requires further details to be specified, such as the distance
travelled, the fuel efficiency of the vehicle used and the number of
passengers carried, and the underlying electricity mix for the country
of travel. In the UK for instance, driving alone in a medium-sized
petrol-fuelled car yields smaller <span data-acronym-label="ghg"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">ghg</span> emissions than air travel
for distances shorter than 1,000 km, whereas flying in economy class
beats driving over longer distances <span class="citation"
data-cites="OWIDtravel"><sup>136</sup></span> (data taken from
Ref. <span class="citation" data-cites="BEIS"><sup>137</sup></span>).<a
href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> For a detailed comparison of
emissions due to various forms of transport within France, see Figure <a
href="#fig:emiMobility" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:emiMobility">10</a>.</p>
<p>When and how we travel, however, are not always free choices, being
constrained to some degree by existing transport infrastructure, local
geography, our research, finances, and caring responsibilities.
Universities and HECAP+ institutions, with their large and progressive
workforce, can help tip the balance in favour of the more
environmentally sustainable option with a judicious combination of
policy, incentives, on-site infrastructure and advocacy, as detailed
below.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, efforts to limit emissions resulting from travel must
be balanced against legitimate needs for mobility: the establishing and
maintenance of close collaborative relationships, sharing of research
outputs, individual exposure and career development, and travel to
research facilities. Changes to our travel culture and policies must be
implemented so as to benefit and, at the very least, not to worsen
barriers to inclusion, by avoiding the disenfranchisement of members of
our community such as early career researchers, members of our community
from the global south or those otherwise geographically isolated.</p>
<p>Our current societal infrastructure is set up to facilitate
individual travel by car, to the detriment of a large part of the
population. Universities, as large employers with a relatively
progressive workforce, have the potential to act as instigators of
change in this. Making public transport and cycling the preferred
options when possible will increase demand for these more sustainable
forms of transport and thus encourage cities to improve the
infrastructure for them.</p>

<h2 id="commuting">Commuting</h2>
<p>Changes in commuting patterns are typically affected by life
circumstances, including changes in education, employment and
residence <span class="citation"
data-cites="BEIGE2017179"><sup>138</sup></span>. The viability of the
environmentally sustainable mobility, like walking, cycling and taking
the train, depends crucially on characteristics of the home and
workplace locations, including the distance between them, and their
local environment. These properties are seen to influence the relative
importance of commuting and business emissions for different
HECAP+ institutions.</p>
<p>For example, CERN, Fermilab, and ETH Zürich have wildly different
<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> emission profiles due
to personal transportation. While emissions due to commuting were
roughly equal to those for business travel at Fermilab, commuting
outweighed business travel for CERN, and conversely, business travel
swamped commuting emissions for ETH. This reflects the unique
environment and characteristics of each these research centres.</p>
<p>ETH is located in an urban centre and is well connected to the local
public transport. In 2008, only 1,700 <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{tCO}_2\mathrm{e}\)</span> were recorded
for commuting, with 7.5 to 10 times larger emissions attributable to
business travel (using numbers from 2006–2012). It is clear here that
the emissions per capita for all staff (including researchers) are
significantly smaller than those for Fermilab or CERN.</p>
<p>The latter two have more rural settings, with a 77 % majority of CERN
employees commuting by car from France. Fermilab’s commuter
emissions <span class="citation"
data-cites="FermilabEnvReport"><sup>139</sup></span> of about 6,000
<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{tCO}_2\mathrm{e}\)</span> are
approximately on par with business travel emissions,<a href="#fn23"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>
whilst CERN quotes 5,836 <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{tCO}_2\mathrm{e}\)</span> of commuter
emissions compared to 3,330 <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{tCO}_2\mathrm{e}\)</span> business travel
emissions for its approximate 4,000 staff members. The small amount of
travel emissions compared to emissions from commuting reflects to some
extent the status of CERN as scientific centre, where it is expected for
other members of the community to travel to and where travel is easier
to avoid, also because the experiments are located at CERN. Whilst ETH,
Fermilab and CERN face different boundary conditions, all three of them,
and HECAP+ institutions in general, should aim to reduce emissions from
commuting, even if these contribute to their overall budget to a
different degree.</p>
<p>This reduction requires an interplay of institutional and individual
actions: while institutions cannot force employees to choose more
environmentally sustainable commuting habits, they can incentivise them
through various measures, from the availability of bicycle-friendly
infrastructure such as showers and secured/covered parking to financial
incentives for greener transportation. They can also allow employees to
avoid long commutes by formalising telecommuting options, which have
become more normalised since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and use
their standing to push local authorities towards better public
transit/cycling/carpool infrastructure. Individuals and groups can, on
the other hand, push for these actions at the institutional level.

data-reference="tab:subCommute">1</a> collects some means by which ETH,
Fermilab and other academic and HECAP+ institutes promote ‘green’

<h2 id="business-travel">Business Travel</h2>
<p>A global scientific endeavour such as HECAP+ will mandate some amount
of long-distance travel, e.g., to experimental sites, or to build close
working relationships. However, the current academic culture which
rewards hyper-mobility is neither environmentally sustainable, nor
equitable to all scientists. Visa rules and prohibitive long-haul travel
costs can make participation in conferences extremely challenging,
especially for researchers from the Global South. Moreover, the freedom
to travel can be heavily restricted for people with disabilities, health
impairments or caring responsibilities. For example, the burden of
childcare is still unequally distributed, and this burden falls
predominately on female shoulders <span class="citation"
data-cites="McCarthy"><sup>144</sup></span>.</p>
<p>Emissions from commercial aviation is a long-recognised problem,
contributing 2.5% of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> emissions and 3.5% of
‘effective radiative forcing’ (a closer measure of aviation’s impact on
warming as explained above) <span class="citation"
data-cites="Rit20"><sup>145</sup></span> in 2018. Note that the majority
of these emissions derive from the one-tenth of the world’s population
that can afford air travel. Almost all HECAP+ scientists belong to the
4% of the population taking international flights, and many fall within
the 1% classified as the most frequent flyers <span class="citation"
data-cites="GOSSLING2020102194"><sup>146</sup></span>. These statistics
highlight the inequalities inherent in travel emissions generally.</p>
<p>More troubling is that global aviation statistics belie the
significance of business travel emissions for many HECAP+ researchers,
which are comparable to, and in some cases even dwarf, their direct and
indirect emissions (see Figure <a href="#fig:Intro-ComparativeEmissions"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:Intro-ComparativeEmissions">4</a>). This is clearly
in tension with the push to net zero emissions, particularly given that
we do not expect the aviation sector to decarbonise at the same rate as
the rest of the transport sector.</p>
<p>Emissions related to conference travel have been studied in detail
and dominate conference-related emissions <span class="citation"
data-cites="Spinellis nature_better_confs"><sup>147,148</sup></span>,
contributing annual emissions equivalent to the total annual
transportation emissions for Geneva (800 kilotonnes <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span>). However, the <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> emissions for a single
conference trip amount to about 7% of an average individual’s total
<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> emissions. This might
be even worse for HECAP+ researchers, for whom frequent trips to
experimental sites and meeting venues to undertake international
collaborations are common.</p>
<p>Discussions about curbing business travel are highly charged, as
active engagement with other members of the scientific community is
integral to scientific practice. Any changes that we make to
HECAP+ travel culture have to be considered in the context of other
aspects of our working practices, such as hiring decisions, where any
curbs on travel may, e.g., disproportionately impact early career
researchers. At the same time, the reprioritisation of business travel
and a move toward a greater share of virtual/hybrid formats can have a
positive impact both on the climate and on inclusivity.</p>
<p>For necessary travel, sustainable alternatives to air travel should
be prioritised where possible, keeping in mind that the increased travel
time and costs of sustainable travel as compared with air travel could
make this choice difficult for researchers with caregiving
responsibilities, or limited travel budgets. In case study Case Study <a
href="#case:traveltoCERN" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="case:traveltoCERN">[case:traveltoCERN]</a>, we compare
emissions, travel time and cost of different modes of travel to CERN,
from various starting points within Europe, for CMS week in January
2022. HECAP+ institutions and funding bodies are beginning to implement
more sustainable travel policies, including travel top-ups for green
travel; we highlight two examples in Best Practice <a href="#bp:Erasmus"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="bp:Erasmus">[bp:Erasmus]</a>
and Best Practice <a href="#bp:DESY_travel" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="bp:DESY_travel">[bp:DESY_travel]</a>.</p>
<p>If the community is to rethink this travel culture and move toward
more hybrid/virtual modes of engagement, we must recognise that these
require additional planning to maximise engagement, which amounts to
much more than streaming the in-person event format (see Case Study <a
href="#cs:CfH" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="cs:CfH">[cs:CfH]</a>). It is also important to
appreciate that virtual participation requires an internet-ready device
and stable connection, and devices with which to connect, which may not
be universally available in lower income countries. A possible remedy
for this might be the concept of hub conferences, where the conference
has several locations spread globally (e.g., Ref. <span class="citation"
data-cites="Parncutt"><sup>149</sup></span>). In Case Study <a
href="#case:ICHEP" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="case:ICHEP">[case:ICHEP]</a>, we study travel emissions
and participation in the context of the last 5 ICHEP conferences, and
assess the reduction in emissions from optimising the conference
location, moving to a hub model, or hybrid/virtual forms of
attendance.</p>

The itineraries in Table <a href="#tab:CERNtravel"

significantly smaller for rail travel as compared with travel by car or

time, and in many cases, cost of rail travel. Note that the air travel
times are underestimated as they do not include travel to the airports
which are usually distant from the city centres, or the usual buffer
time required for check-in and security formalities. For itineraries
that include sleeper trains, the additional cost of the train could
offset a night’s hotel accommodation at origin or destination.</p>

<p><span><strong>Case Study : Comparative study of travel carbon
footprint for ICHEP conferences (2012–2020)<span id="case:ICHEP"
label="case:ICHEP"></span></strong></span><br />
Based on the study of the annual meetings of the American Geophysical
Union (AGU) in Ref. <span class="citation"
data-cites="RefAGU"><sup>140</sup></span> and the methodology and
software tools employed therein, we undertake a survey of the past five
editions of the International Conference for High Energy Physics (ICHEP)
with the aim of assessing the GHG emissions of conference travel to
ICHEP, as well as the (geographical) diversity of participants.</p>
<p>ICHEP is a biannual conference with a large and steadily growing
participation, of order 1,000 researchers, and a location that
alternates mainly between Europe, America and Asia. We study the 5 most
recent instances, with locations in Melbourne, Australia (2012),
Valencia, Spain (2014), Chicago, United States, (2016), Seoul, Korea
(2018) and Prague, Czech Republic (2020, fully virtual). At the time of
writing the 2022 conference, to be held in Bologna, had not yet
begun.</p>
<h4 id="methodology">Methodology</h4>
<p>Participant details were taken from the Indico conference system
registration pages <span class="citation"
data-cites="indico"><sup>152</sup></span>. The departure location for
each participant was assumed to be the city of their affiliation, save
for cases where it was clear that the participant was based in Geneva,
as is often the case for members of LHC collaborations. Direct travel to
and from the conference was assumed. Distances were calculated as the
great circle distance using coordinates obtained with Nominatim from the
OpenStreet Map data base. Rail, car or bus travel was assumed for all
journeys with distances of less than 400 km, with air travel assumed for
longer distances. ‘Short-haul’ was defined as travel distances of less
than 1,500 km; distances up to 8,000 km are ‘long-haul’ and longer
distance still were classified as ‘super long-haul’.</p>

<p>Table <a href="#tab:icheppart" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="tab:icheppart">[tab:icheppart]</a> shows the average GHG
emissions per participant for the ICHEP editions alongside those for the
2019 AGU Fall Meeting for reference. With the exception of the 2012
Melbourne edition of ICHEP, the per capita emissions were significantly
lower for ICHEP, which is a “travelling” conference, as compared with
the stationary AGU Meeting, which always takes place in San Francisco.
This indicates that moving a conference series between continents
naturally reduces the travel-related emissions as participants tend to
wait for the conference to be held near them to make the trip. Comparing
the geographical distribution of home institutes for each conference
reinforces this conclusion. Note that ICHEP Melbourne (2012) was the
first and only ICHEP conference taking place in Oceania.</p>
<p>The emissions for two typical ICHEP conferences, one in Europe
(Valencia) and the other further removed, in Asia (Seoul) are displayed
as a function of travel distance in Figure <a href="#fig:EmmPerDistance"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:EmmPerDistance">[fig:EmmPerDistance]</a> below. Due
to the remote nature of the conference location, a large fraction of
attendees at the Seoul conference had to fly super-long-haul to get
there, giving rise to the majority of the emissions. Emissions for the
remaining half of the attendees was nearly negligible. This was not the
case for Valencia, where as many attendees travelled short haul travel
or less. It is also clear that the bulk of the emissions is due to
long-haul or super-long-haul air travel.</p>
<div class="center">
<p><br />
</p>
</div>
<p>Reference <span class="citation"
data-cites="RefAGU"><sup>140</sup></span> investigated possible
optimizations of the conference location for the given participant
distribution in order to reduce emissions.<a href="#fn25"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>
Note that this is a slightly artificial construction because of the
basin of attraction phenomenon discussed above, where participant
distribution is self-selecting, based on the conference location. Unlike
the AGU example, where moving the conference location to the middle of
the country, rather than on a coast, significantly decreased the
travel-related emissions, we found that the ICHEP locations were already
pre-optimised, and further optimisation yielded at most a 10.2 %
reduction of GHG emissions. (The real outlier again was Melbourne, where
the majority of participants had to fly super long-haul, and for which a
70.7 % reduction would be achievable given the same participants by
changing the location). If instead we optimised the location using
participants from all 5 ICHEPs, the optimal location would be close to
Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Further emissions reductions are only possible with a hub-based
conference, and mandatory virtual participation above a certain distance
from the hubs. Ref. <span class="citation"
data-cites="RefAGU"><sup>140</sup></span> trialled hubs in Chicago,
Seoul and Paris, with virtual attendance for all participants with
origins greater than 2000 km from the hubs. Having found that Chicago,
Seoul and Paris were not far from the optimal locations for the
respective ICHEP conferences, we did the same, for the total ICHEP
participation over the 5 conferences. Simply using a 3-hub model can
reduce the carbon footprint of the conference to around 15–35 % of a
traditional one. Adding compulsory virtual participation for more
distant participants reduces the carbon footprint further by 5–15 % of a
traditional conference with 10–25 % of the participants attending
virtually. As a test case, and without any prior optimization, we chose
Rio de Janeiro, Johannesburg, and Kolkata as alternative hubs. This,
however, increased virtual participation to 95 %¸ mainly due to the
strong European participation in HEP and the remoteness of Johannesburg
from Western Europe. Switching Paris for Johannesburg reduced the
footprint to about 10 % of the nominal one, with 40% of participants
attending virtually. While the virtual fraction is still relatively
high, it might be acceptable in a bid to include more remote HEP
communities (like Melbourne) while keeping the emissions low.</p>
<p>Finally, one might expect a fully virtual conference to be more
inclusive than in-person ones, especially for underserved participants,
such as those with care-giving responsibilities, limited travel funding,
or visa problems. We studied this by classifying participants by the
human development index (HDI) <span class="citation"
data-cites="hdiref"><sup>153</sup></span> of their country of
affiliation, and dividing them into four categories (low, medium, high
and very high HDI).<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> The share of participants in these
categories for each of the ICHEP conferences is shown in Figure <a
href="#fig:DevelopmentIndex" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:DevelopmentIndex">[fig:DevelopmentIndex]</a>.
Indeed, in addition to enjoying the largest number of participants (by a
factor of 2), the virtual ICHEP in Prague had the largest proportion of
participants from countries with high or medium human development index,
although it was not clear how much of this increase was due to its
virtual nature, as opposed to a steady increase in physics participation
from high and medium-HDI countries. There was virtually no participation
from low HDI countries in any of the ICHEP conferences studied.</p>

The EU mobility and training programme Erasmus+ has implemented funding
top-ups for environmentally sustainable travel, which is more costly
than point-to-point air travel in many instances, in particular between
hubs for low-cost airline. See Table <a

large distances can be more time-consuming. The programme allows for
this by providing travel support for an additional 4 days of travel.</p>

<p><span><strong>Best Practice : Internal regulations to reduce the
impact of business travel at DESY<span id="bp:DESY_travel"
label="bp:DESY_travel"></span></strong></span><br />
The regulations at DESY have been based on the goal of preserving the
excellence of science and career opportunities while reacting to the
necessity to save <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> and
other emissions. With its directive for business trips adopted in 2021,
DESY relies on the climate policy principle Avoid - Reduce -
Compensate.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid:</strong> The number of business trips will be reduced
by 30 % compared to the situation before the start of the COVID-19
pandemic. This means that all travel planning is reviewed to identify
whether the trip is needed to achieve the intended purpose, whether a
virtual meeting could be just as beneficial, whether rotational changes
between presence and digital are possible, and whether and how
appointments can be bundled. In addition to <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> savings and travel time, it
should also be considered how much of the time spent traveling and for
travel planning can actually be used as working time, and what costs are
incurred or saved. Ultimately, digital meetings also contribute to a
better flexibility of family and work life. They also reduce
travel-related risks.</p>
<p><strong>Reduce:</strong> For some time now, it has already been
possible to use the train instead of the plane, even if the costs were
higher. With the new directive, the use of the train is now mandatory if
the destination can be reached within six hours total travel time. It
should also be noted that the usable working time during the trip for
rail travel is given as at least 50% of the travel time (depending on
the transfer frequency) and for flying it is assumed to be about 25% of
the travel time.</p>
<p><strong>Compensate:</strong> Until recently, compensation was not
possible under the Federal Travel Expenses Act. However, since September
2020, there is a new regulation on the reimbursement policy for carbon
offsets from the German ministry of science, whereby also grant
recipients like DESY are allowed to offset their <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> emissions for business
trips. Starting in 2021, DESY will compensate the consequences of
unavoidable air travel. There are established systems through which the
climate-damaging effects of travel can be offset. The money goes to
climate protection projects, including energy efficiency, biogas or
biomass, solar energy, and environmental education. The selection of the
compensation projects can be steered by DESY.</p>

<p><span><strong>Case Study : Cosmology from Home<a href="#fn27"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a><span id="cs:CfH"
label="cs:CfH"></span></strong></span><br />
Cosmology from Home (CfH) <span class="citation"
data-cites="CfHwebsite"><sup>155</sup></span> is an "online by design"
conference series that has been run on a yearly basis since 2020. It
exploits the advantages of digital communication to accomplish things
that have no analogue in traditional conference formats, while staying
true to the dynamic and social nature of traditional conferences.</p>
<p>CfH is spread over two weeks, with two days per week dedicated to
plenary and parallel talks. Talks are pre-recorded and shared with the
conference participants ahead of the start of the conference. Other than
a strict time limit, CfH places few constraints on the format of the
talks. Participants are expected to watch the talks before the scheduled
online discussion events. The discussions last a maximum of three hours
per day to mitigate online fatigue, but multiple sessions can be
scheduled to accommodate different time zones.</p>
<p>Other days are reserved for themed discussions, which are proposed by
the participants. Topics have included content related directly to
cosmology, to scientific research more generally (i.e., technical or
computational aspects), and social aspects, such as inclusivity and
outreach in science.</p>
<p>The live discussions are hosted in virtual conference venue spaces to
create a social atmosphere in which participants can wander around and
join conversations. Suitable conference spaces are, e.g., Sococo <span
class="citation" data-cites="Sococo"><sup>156</sup></span>, Welo <span
class="citation" data-cites="Welo"><sup>157</sup></span> and
Gather <span class="citation" data-cites="Gather"><sup>158</sup></span>.
In case the number of participants is such that the conference spaces
are too small to host everyone at once, break-out rooms of a suitable
video-conferencing platform can be used. In the specific case of CfH so
far this has been Zoom <span class="citation"
data-cites="Zoom"><sup>159</sup></span>.</p>
<p>CfH is coordinated asynchronously through an online message board,
and a large part of the conference is dedicated to asynchronous
text-based discussions. These discussions can start before the official
opening of the conference and continue long after the conference has
finished. In previous years, CfH used Slack <span class="citation"
data-cites="Slack"><sup>160</sup></span>. (Alternatives include
MatterMost <span class="citation"
data-cites="MatterMost"><sup>161</sup></span>, Zulip <span
class="citation" data-cites="Zulip"><sup>162</sup></span>, Microsoft
Teams <span class="citation" data-cites="Teams"><sup>163</sup></span> or
Discord <span class="citation"
data-cites="Discord"><sup>164</sup></span>.) Discussion channels are
grouped according to the scheduled live-talk discussion sessions (see
below). Participants can discuss points in dedicated threads in these
channels. Once a given discussion has grown sufficiently and has
branched out into different sub-discussions, it can be given its own
dedicated channel.</p>
<p>In addition to scheduled talk discussions, CfH implements scheduled
themed discussions. These are moderated, workshop-style discussions on
cosmological themes that are of interest to the conference participants.
The topics are suggested, voted on and chosen via the Slack workspace.
People can connect to the session via the conference space, but the main
session is hosted in Zoom break-out rooms.</p>
<p>The final live discussion format featured by CfH is composed of
spontaneous and unscheduled<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> “informal” live
discussions. The time allocated to the scheduled live discussions is
limited, and the informal, breakaway sessions allow the participants to
engage in more detailed explorations of topics.</p>
<p>The final live component of CfH consists of social events and
interaction formats, such as social games and casual get-togethers,
which complement the scientific discussion sessions on all days of the
conference. These activities aim to reproduce (at least partially) the
evening interactions of in-person conference social events.</p>
<p>One of the main advantages of the CfH format is the possibility for
researchers to present and debate their work, and that of others,
without the need for travel. This keeps the participation costs low and
offers the potential for the conference to be carbon neutral or carbon
negative (achieved, at present, through carbon offsetting of residual
emissions). The online format also makes the conference accessible to
researchers from all over the world, subject to the availability of a
suitable device and a stable internet connection by which to connect.
The geographical distribution of participants in the previous three CfH
conferences are shown in Figure <a href="#fig:CfH1"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:CfH1">[fig:CfH1]</a>.</p>
<div class="center">
<p><img src="Sections/Figs/Travel/map.png"  /></p>
</div>
<p>Additionally, participants can watch the talks according to their own
schedules and personal obligations. Participants are able to pause and
restart the talks, take time to digest them and to look up background
material. They are also able to prepare and raise points for discussion
in any of the conference environments. The asynchronous discussions can
be tailored exactly to the schedule of the conference participants.</p>
<p>In the first CfH (2020), participants needed time to adjust to the
format. This was to be expected, and the organisers actively encouraged
participants to partake of the various aspects of the conference and
actively modelled the expected social norms. The activity and enthusiasm
of participation increased year on year. Speakers created innovative and
accessible talk records, and participants regularly referred to these in
the live and text-based discussions. Participants organised watch
parties and impromptu discussions, made use of the various breakout
rooms, and gathered in the virtual environments. The themed discussions
proved to be particularly popular, and parallel sessions were often
necessary to accommodate the high number of topic suggestions.</p>
<p>All participant feedback has been constructive and positive, and CfH
has been well attended. The number of CfH participants were 255, 427 and
275 in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively <span class="citation"
data-cites="CfHwebsite"><sup>155</sup></span>. The format is easily
tailored to various topics: a conference featuring this format in HEP is
expected to be run late 2023.</p>

<p>A major aspect of sustainability in HECAP+ is the research
infrastructure itself. The accelerators, experiments, observatories,
setups and buildings have a lifetime impact from cradle to grave. This
is recognised in section 8 of Sustainability Considerations of the
European Strategy for Particle Physics <span class="citation"
data-cites="EuropStrategyPP"><sup>165</sup></span>. It divides the topic
into three aspects: Energy efficient technologies, Energy efficient
accelerator concepts and General sustainability aspects. The first two
focus on the biggest impact of accelerators: the energy consumption
during their operation. One aspect focuses on the current technology and
its energy efficiency, the other one on the development of new
accelerating concepts with smaller energy requirements. These topics are
discussed more in depth in other sections of the Strategy. The third one
broadens the view to an overall sustainability beyond energy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A carbon footprint analysis in the design phase of a new facility
can help to optimize energy consumption for construction and operation.
For cooling purposes accelerator facilities typically have significant
water consumption. Cooling systems can be optimized to minimize the
impact on the environment. For the construction of a facility
environment-friendly materials should be identified and used preferably.
The mining of certain materials, in particular rare earths, takes place
in some countries under precarious conditions. It is desirable to
introduce and comply with certification of the sources of such materials
for industrial applications, including the construction of accelerators.
A thoughtful life-cycle management of components will minimize
waste."</p>

<p>To estimate the impact and the sustainability of the technology

a Life-Cycle Assessment is mandatory. As a start, this could include a
standardized way to report the energy consumption of equipment and

</figure>
<p>The sustainability aspects of future facilities will become an
increasingly important factor in the decision process about which, if
any, facility should be built. To evaluate the <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> footprint of the
electricity consumption of a future colliders and therefore its impact
is complex. The assumptions such as "in 2045, electricity will be <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> neutral anyway" or "only
buy green electricity, therefore the <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> impact of the used
electricity is zero" are debatable. To use the currently valid <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\)</span> footprint for electrical
energy is of course not entirely correct either, as this will most
likely change by the time operation of the facilities begins.
Additionally, the argumentation of "electrical effectiveness" should be
discussed. What are scientifically relevant benchmarks and which ones
make sense, e.g. kWh/Higgs or kWh/luminosity compared to the required
connected power? It could therefore be important to plan these
facilities in such a way that they can adapt at least some of their
power consumption to the real availability of renewable energy.</p>
<p>Thinking about the life cycle of such facilities is another complex
subject. Not only the accelerator itself, but also the tunnel and the
entire infrastructure. The impact of construction, then deconstruction
(except for the tunnel) and disposal (including activated materials,
which may constitute a radiation hazard) after a few years is not
negligible.</p>

<p>The operation of particle accelerator facilities is inherently
resource-intensive, and thus poses a challenge to sustainability. In
line with acknowledging our responsibility for sustainable usage of
energy resources, the development, establishment, and demonstration of a
scalable multi-turn Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) with efficient energy
recycling was implemented at the S-DALINAC accelerator at TU Darmstadt,
Germany <span class="citation"
data-cites="Arnold:2020snn"><sup>177</sup></span>. An efficient
energy-recycling in multi-turn operation with a saving of up to 87 % of
the beam power-consumption in the main LINAC has been recently
demonstrated. This result, together with further developments on
multi-turn ERLs is a promising basis for future high-power beams that
truly support sustainability aspects. (ER@CEBAF, USA <span

<p><span><strong>Case Study : Sustainability of plasma wakefield

</p>
<p>A promising technology which would reduce both the material and
energy cost of accelerating particles, and hence improve its
environmental sustainability, is wakefield acceleration.<span
class="citation" data-cites="wakefield1"><sup>185</sup></span> These use
laser pulses (in the case of laser wakefield accelerators), or particle
beam bunches (for plasma wakefield accelerators, or PWFAs) as the driver
to accelerate plasma electrons, creating ion cavities. This creates an
electric field that pulls electrons back to their original positions,
which they overshoot, creating waves in the plasma, known as the
wakefield. These plasma waves can accelerate electrons by transferring
energy from the drive beam to electrons by putting electrons just behind
the drive beam. Wakefield technology routinely gives acceleration gains
of <span class="math inline">\(10-100\)</span>GeV/m<span
class="citation" data-cites="wakefield1"><sup>185</sup></span>, thus
resulting in a significant reduction of the resources required
(materials, energy) to build particle accelerators. For example,
accelerating electrons to 1 TeV of energy using PWFA would require
e.g., only a 21 km-long particle accelerator, while CLIC technology
needs 52 km <span class="citation"

<p>In a world with increasing demand on limited resources and undergoing

consider energy consumption, sustainability and efficiency when
discussing our scientific proposals. To this end the Framework Technical
Design Report of the next-generation LHCb Upgrade II experiment <span
class="citation" data-cites="LHCbU2FTDR"><sup>187</sup></span> has
included a dedicated chapter on these considerations analysing the
current Upgrade I system and indicating directions for future
investigation. This section reports some of the main elements.</p>
<p>The 2020 update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics <span
class="citation" data-cites="EuropeanStrategy2020"><sup>188</sup></span>
reports: “The environmental impact of particle physics activities should
continue to be carefully studied and minimised. A detailed plan for the
minimisation of environmental impact and for the saving and re-use of
energy should be part of the approval process for any major project.
Alternatives to travel should be explored and encouraged.” As one of the
major experimental infrastructures operating at the LHC, our
environmental protection strategy should be made in coordination with
CERN guidelines, as described in the first CERN environment report <span
class="citation" data-cites="envrep2020"><sup>189</sup></span>.</p>
<p>CERN has a formal objective to reduce direct emissions (“Scope 1”) by
<span class="math inline">\(28\%\)</span> by the end of 2024. These are
dominated by the activities of the LHC experiments, and in particular by
the use of fluorinated gases for particle detection and detector cooling
purposes, as shown in Fig. <a href="#fig:cern_co2"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:cern_co2">12</a>. These
emissions have to be carefully considered in the operation of the
Upgrade I detector and in the design of its future upgrade. Other
relevant aspects of the environmental impact of our project are the
power consumption of the experimental infrastructure (indirect
emissions, “Scope 2”), the impact of digital technologies, and travel of
the members of the collaboration. Fig. <a href="#fig:lhcb_co2"

</figure>
<h4 id="direct-emissions">Direct emissions</h4>
<p>Direct emissions from LHCb are dominated by losses of gases with
sizeable global warming potential (<span data-acronym-label="gwp"
data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">gwp</span>). The GWP is the heat
absorbed by a greenhouse gas in the atmosphere as a multiple of the same
mass of CO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>. It thus allows
conversion into CO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> equivalent
emissions. As some gases breakdown they have time-dependent values and
we use the 100 year value <span class="citation"
data-cites="AR5"><sup>190</sup></span>. The gases are utilised in LHCb
in detector cooling systems and in the detection systems. Improvements
made in the cooling systems of LHCb mean that emissions are now
dominated by the detection system in Upgrade I. All systems are closed,
with emissions being the result of losses.</p>
<p>In the original LHCb detector of Run 1 and 2 the gas C<span
class="math inline">\(_6\)</span>F<span
class="math inline">\(_{14}\)</span> (GWP 7910) was used in cooling
plants. For upgrade I “Novec 649" (GWP 1) is planned to be used and
increased use of low-impact CO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>
based cooling. For Upgrade II, lower operating temperatures are foreseen
and the GWP of the cooling systems will be considered.</p>
<p>In the detector systems the Ring Imaging Cherenkov Systems (RICH1 and
2) and Muon systems of Upgrade I use greenhouse gases. The RICH2 system
currently uses CF<span class="math inline">\(_4\)</span> (GWP 6630) and
RICH1 C<span class="math inline">\(_4\)</span>F<span
class="math inline">\(_{10}\)</span> (GWP 9200) radiators. R&amp;D will
be pursued for Upgrade II on alternative gases, RICH2 is looking at
CO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> use where a test has already
been performed, and leakless systems. Significant effort has been made
to minimise leaks. In the original LHCb detector GEM detectors (gas
electron multiplier detectors) were utilised in a part of the muon
system, the removal of these for Upgrade I reduces the detector system
emissions by 40%. Recirculating systems are used throughout. The study
of alternative gas mixture will be conducted to reduce the CF<span
class="math inline">\(_4\)</span> consumption in the proposed future
muon systems.</p>
<p>The CO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> equivalent emissions
expected in Run 3 are shown in figure <a href="#fig:LHCbCO2e"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:LHCbCO2e">14</a>. These

</figure>
<h4 id="sec:powerconsumption">Power consumption</h4>
<p>CERN peak power demand, with the full accelerator chain running, is
about <span class="math inline">\(180\)</span> MW, which brings the
total annual energy consumption to <span
class="math inline">\(1.2\)</span> TWh. This very large energy demand is
partially mitigated by the fact that the electricity procurement is
mainly from France, whose production capacity is 87.9<span
class="math inline">\(\%\)</span> carbon-free (2017-figures).<a
href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> This keeps the contribution from
the electrical power to the total CERN emission budget below 20<span
class="math inline">\(\%\)</span>, as shown in Fig <a
href="#fig:cern_co2" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:cern_co2">12</a>. Nevertheless, guided by the Energy
Management Panel, EMP, CERN is spending a large effort to improve energy
efficiency, with special focus on the accelerator sector. As an example,
in the transition to the HL-LHC, with a tenfold increase in luminosity,
the Organization’s immediate priority is to limit the increase in energy
consumption to 5<span class="math inline">\(\%\)</span> up to the end of
2024.</p>
<p>LHCb during a normal data taking period of Run 2 had a peak power
demand of stably around 5.5 MW, of which 4.6 MW was from the experiment
dipole magnet and the rest from the detector electronics and the online
computing farm. The Run 3 expectation is for an increase of <span
class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span>1.5 MW due to the increased demand of
data processing power, which is to be compared to the five-fold increase
in luminosity. For Run 5 and beyond, the contribution of online
computing is expected to increase substantially, as a consequence of a
further order of magnitude increase in the data throughput.</p>
<p>For the power dissipated by the LHCb magnet, an important mitigation
has been implemented very recently by CERN with the installation of a
heat-recovery plant at the experimental site. This is intended to use
the hot water produced by the magnet and the machine cooling systems to
heat a new residential area in the town of Ferney-Voltaire next to the
LHCb site. Thanks to this project, up to 8000 people’s homes will be
heated at a lower cost and with reduced CO<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> emissions, corresponding to <span
class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span>2.5% of the total CERN emission
budget per year.</p>
<h4 id="digital-technologies">Digital technologies</h4>
<p>The power consumption of the online computing farm at LHCb has been
about 530 kW on average during Run 2 of the LHC. To cope with the
significantly increased computing needs after Upgrade I, a new data
centre has recently been installed at Point 8 and the power consumption
for computing is going to increase to 2000 kW for the upcoming data
taking periods. The new computing data centre at Point 8 is located in a
surface building and for practical reasons could not be included in the
heat recovery project discussed in Sec. <a href="#sec:powerconsumption"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:powerconsumption">6.3.0.2</a> above. However, great
care has been put into the design to optimize its power efficiency, for
example by implementing a state-of-the-art indirect free air cooling
system with adiabatic assist <span class="citation"
data-cites="lbldcreport"><sup>192</sup></span>. A <span
data-acronym-label="pue" data-acronym-form="singular+abbrv">pue</span>
of better than 1.08 has been achieved for the new data centre at
Point 8, a value that compares favourably with other large computing
centres <span class="citation"
data-cites="pue-data"><sup>193</sup></span>.</p>
<p>While it does not seem feasible to further improve the PUE of the
data centre, energy savings could potentially be achieved by adjusting
the operating mode to the actual computing needs at a given point in
time. Significant improvements in energy efficiency can be achieved by
rewriting software so that it can efficiently exploit today’s highly
parallel computing architectures. LHCb has been doing this in
preparation for Run 3 datataking and the impact of these activities on
the energy efficiency of our software has been documented in <span
class="citation" data-cites="hlt1-energy-eff"><sup>194</sup></span>. In
total the energy efficiency of HLT1 software has been improved by a
factor <span class="math inline">\(4.8\times\)</span> on CPUs, with the
improvements coming in roughly equal parts from physics optimizations
and the rewrite of the underlying software framework. A further
improvement in energy efficiency can also be achieved by porting
suitable algorithms from CPU to more efficient technologies such as GPU,
FPGA or even custom-made ASICs. LHCb has demonstrated this with the
Allen project <span class="citation"
data-cites="Allen"><sup>195</sup></span>, which implemented HLT1 on
GPUs, leading to an overall improvement in energy efficiency of up to
<span class="math inline">\(19\times\)</span> compared to the Run 2
architecture. These improvements require significant effort and
investment, above all in the training and retention of scientists able
to effectively program across a range of modern computing
architectures.</p>
<p>The energy efficiency of the underlying computer hardware has also
improved substantially over time. For example, the AMD 7502 <span
class="citation" data-cites="AMD7502"><sup>196</sup></span> CPUs which
were evaluated as candidates for LHCb’s Run 3 HLT are <span
class="math inline">\(2.6\times\)</span> more energy efficient than the
benchmark E5-2630 Xeon CPUs used by LHCb during Run 2. Within a given
computing architecture, energy savings can also be achieved by
purchasing more expensive, higher quality hardware. As an example from
the world of CPU, the more expensive AMD 7742 <span class="citation"
data-cites="AMD7742"><sup>197</sup></span> provides twice the number of
CPU cores and threads as the cheaper AMD 7502 <span class="citation"
data-cites="AMD7502"><sup>196</sup></span>, while its specified power
consumption is only 25% higher. The energy consumption and carbon
footprint from data transfer, data storage and offline computing are
much harder to assess than those for online computing, due to the
distributed nature of the computing model with data centres and users
distributed over many different countries. The GRAND collaboration has
performed pioneering work in this direction <span class="citation"
data-cites="GRAND"><sup>198</sup></span>.</p>
<h4 id="mobility">Mobility</h4>
<p>As an international collaboration operating in an international field
of research, travel is an intrinsic part of how LHCb operates. We have
estimated the environmental impact of travel in order to attend LHCb
collaboration meetings and international conferences. We have taken into
account local commuter travel or travel related to on-site work at LHCb,
such as shifts, although this is probably significant.</p>

week, pre-pandemic, corresponded to around <span
class="math inline">\(0.5\,\mathrm{tCO_2e}\)</span> with the average
LHCb week in 2019 leading to travel-emissions of <span
class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> 180<span
class="math inline">\(\,\mathrm{tCO_2e}\)</span>. The Speakers’ Bureau
database provides a complete record of all LHCb conference talks,
allowing us to estimate the environmental impact in terms of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{tCO_2e}\)</span> per year. LHCb weeks and
conference travel contribute a total of approximately <span
class="math inline">\(1,000\,\mathrm{tCO_2e}\)</span> per annum, a
similar carbon footprint to the Run 3 experiment’s projected electricity
use due to online computing and the magnet (French energy mix). LHCb
weeks contribute about three times as much to LHCb’s carbon footprint as
conference travel. The carbon footprint of virtual conference attendance
is calculated according to the life-cycle and operating costs of
endpoint devices estimates in Ref. <span class="citation"
data-cites="VideoConCO2"><sup>199</sup></span>, and is small.</p>
<p>LHCb, in common with other HEP collaborations, had extensive
experience with virtual meetings before COVID, and videoconferencing
technology has already helped to reduce travel-related emissions over
the past decade. However the pandemic, as well as recent improvements to
the videoconferencing software infrastructure, have shown us ways in
which the organisation of virtual meetings can be improved and made more
inclusive. At the same time the pandemic has also reminded us of the
ongoing importance of in-person interaction, not least to avoid
fracturing the collaboration between those who can regularly travel to
CERN in eco-friendly ways and those who cannot. The collaboration has
only just started to navigate this tension, but is actively exploring
ways to reduce its travel-related environmental impact.</p>

Standardized accounting of the carbon footprint of French research
institutions: labos1point5 <span id="BP:l1p5"
label="BP:l1p5"></span>]<span>Standardized accounting of the carbon
footprint of French research institutions: labos1point5</span></p>
<p><em>Laboratoires de recherche</em>, loosely translated as research
labs, are the entities around which most of French research is
organised. They enjoy a relevant degree of autonomy, including aspects
such as scientific goals and experimental designs. Access to research
facilities, as well as a fraction of the annual budget is also managed
at the lab scale. Hence, this makes it a relevant scale to tackle the
question of the carbon footprint of academic research.</p>
<p>This has motivated the creation of the <em>labos1point5</em> working
group (<em>Groupement De Recherche</em>, GDR)<a href="#fn30"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>
gathering an interdisciplinary team of engineers and researchers from
various research fields in France. One of the main outputs of this
collaboration is the <em>GES 1point5</em>,<a href="#fn31"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> a
standardized online tool for the accounting of the carbon footprint of
French research labs. What follows is a brief summary of the latter. We
refer to<span class="citation"
data-cites="labos1p5"><sup>141</sup></span> for a publication describing
it. Further information can be found on the website of the labos1point5
collaboration<span class="citation"
data-cites="labos1p5web"><sup>200</sup></span>. The tool itself is
available at<span class="citation"
data-cites="ges1p5"><sup>201</sup></span>, while the open source code is
hosted at<span class="citation"
data-cites="ges1p5git"><sup>202</sup></span>. The GDR labos1point5 is
also active in helping labs in their transition to a lower footprint, in
developing new ways of teaching climate and ecological aspects to
students, as well as of communicating to the general public. Finally,
there are teams dedicated to the reflection on the role of science in
the climate crisis and on fostering collaboration between arts and
science in this context.</p>
<p>As explained in<span class="citation"
data-cites="labos1p5"><sup>141</sup></span>, one of the main motivations
for the creation of the GES 1point5 tool was the difficulty in
aggregating or comparing the results of the many existing studies in the
literature on the carbon footprint of academic research. This difficulty
was caused by the sensitivity of the footprint to the applied
methodology, which made comparisons extremely challenging, since
discrepancies in results could not be disentangled from methodological
differences. The creation of the GES 1point5 was then intended to
provide a tool specifically designed to estimate the carbon footprint of
research with a transparent and accessible methodology and a database of
carbon footprints assessed with the same methodology to enable a robust
comparison of research carbon footprints across institutions, contexts
or disciplines.</p>
<p>More specifically, GES 1point5 allows research labs to estimate their
yearly emissions — as of February 15, 2023, 628 laboratories have
compiled 1140 yearly carbon footprint determinations<span
class="citation" data-cites="labos1p5web"><sup>200</sup></span>.
Currently, GES 1point5 can estimate GHG emissions due to the energy
consumption and refrigerant gases of the labs’ buildings, those
attributed to the purchase of their digital devices and to computing,
commuting, professional travel as well as the associated uncertainties.
A module estimating emissions from consumables’ purchases has recently
been added. In all cases, the estimation is based upon its established
standardised methodology and the database of emission factors and turns
out to be relatively straightforward for the end user.<a href="#fn32"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>
To give an example, commuting emissions are estimated by gathering data
through an anonymised survey sent to staff members, which can be
answered in less than five minutes. For each specified commute (up to
two different ones per week can be entered) GES 1point5 multiplies the
distance traveled via each means of transportation times the specific
emission factor from its database. These are collected in Figure <a
href="#fig:emiMobility" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:emiMobility">10</a> in the section on Mobility. The
underlying routines are available at<span class="citation"
data-cites="1p5commute"><sup>203</sup></span> for everyone to test their
commutes; similarly, those used in the determination of professional
travel emissions are available at<span class="citation"
data-cites="1p5travel"><sup>204</sup></span> and those for purchases
at<span class="citation"
data-cites="1p5purchases"><sup>205</sup></span>.</p>
<p>Once the emissions have been estimated, GES 1point5 presents the
results through its graphic interface, highlighting the main drivers of
the carbon footprint. Finally, emission reduction actions that may be
undertaken after the evaluation of the footprint can be evaluated in the
subsequent years, thanks to the reliance on a standardized protocol. The
latter also allows the aforementioned aggregation and comparison of GES
1point5-based carbon footprints.</p>
<p>As stated in<span class="citation"
data-cites="labos1p5"><sup>141</sup></span>, while some aspects of GES
1point5 are specific to the context of French research, the tool may be
reused in research centers elsewhere, provided the necessary adjustments
— e.g. carbon intensity of the grid — are taken. A French and an English
language version of GES 1point5 are built-in in the current version to
ease deployment in any country; contacts with several institutions
outside France have been established.</p>

<p>Half of the world’s GHG emissions, and over 90% of global water
stress and biodiversity loss events, are due to the extraction and
processing of raw materials <span class="citation"
data-cites="EURaw"><sup>206</sup></span>. Although most extracted
materials are slated for the energy or agriculture sectors, the tiny
remainder directly associated with consumption of goods and services is
nevertheless responsible for 18% of emissions due to EU
consumption <span class="citation"
data-cites="EURaw"><sup>206</sup></span>. Mitigating the climate impacts
of the extraction, processing and trade of raw materials is a priority
for the resilience of the EU <span class="citation"
data-cites="EURaw"><sup>206</sup></span>, and should be one also for the
World climate agenda.</p>
<p>The generation of waste is a direct consequence of material
consumption and is aggravated by constraints in the various stages of
production, distribution, usage and repair, disposal or recycling of
consumables. Waste has severe impacts on life on the land and sea, often
destabilizing local ecosystems, and contributes to climate change, thus
destabilizing the global ecosystem. Accumulations and inefficient
disposal of waste products also directly affect the health of
individuals and communities, when ground water and air are polluted with
toxic agents, leading to a large cost in terms of lives lost and disease
burden on society.</p>
<p>In an attempt to curb the footprints left by the generation of waste,
the concept of a circular economy has been proposed <span
class="citation" data-cites="CircularEconomy"><sup>207</sup></span>. Any
such proposal must also be established in parallel with a will to reduce
waste at source through sustainable procurement, repair and reuse, and
must serve as a transition to this final solution. Circular economy can
significantly aid in this transition to reducing waste, as it is quick
and easy to implement, it has a strong educational role, and is
economically favourable. However even a fully circular economy has some
dissipation, and signatures of this energy waste need to be addressed
separately and reduced <span class="citation"
data-cites="Forbes SocialEurope WRI"><sup>208–210</sup></span>.</p>
<p>Maximizing the sustainability of the use cycle of resources should be
a priority of the HECAP+ community.</p>

<h2 id="subsec:Resources">Resources</h2>
<p>HECAP+ physics can be rather resource-intensive, particularly in the
building and maintenance of the often large experiments that drive
progress in our fields. For instance, procurement accounted for 92% of
CERN’s Scope 3 (indirect) GHG emissions in 2019 <span class="citation"
data-cites="CERNTownHall"><sup>211</sup></span>, and was of the same
order as its Scope 1 contributions in 2018, when the LHC was
running <span class="citation"
data-cites="Environment:2737239"><sup>9</sup></span>. These resources
have an environmental impact over their entire life cycle, due to
extraction of the raw materials used in their manufacture, their
production and use, and their disposal once they become unusable or
obsolete. Of these, the raw materials processing stage has been
highlighted as having the greatest potential for emissions
reduction <span class="citation"
data-cites="EURaw"><sup>206</sup></span>.</p>
<p>The main environmental impacts linked to the extraction of raw
materials are associated with the mining industry <span class="citation"
data-cites="Dolega:2016"><sup>212</sup></span>. Acid mine drainage,
where sulphuric acid produced from water flowing over ore dissolves
heavy metals, thus contaminating groundwater and soil, represents the
main environmental problem of the mining industry and is a serious
threat to water resources. Water resources can also be depleted by
demand from mining operations, particularly in regions of limited water
supply, severely limiting the availability of water to local consumers
and agriculture. Fine particles and dust produced during mining
operations and dispersed by winds affect air quality, and mining and its
infrastructure leads to loss of agricultural land and even entire
ecosystems through contamination or destruction of soil cover. Mining is
the world’s largest producer of waste, with copper, zinc, bauxite and
nickel mining resulting in the largest ratios of waste to mined metal.
Disposal or storage of tailings, the waste products remaining after the
extraction of valuable material from ore, are another major problem.
These can be radioactive, and are sometimes illegally disposed of
directly into rivers or seas. Even when stored ostensibly responsibly in
tailings dams, incorrect geological siting of these dams either in
tectonically active regions, or in regions of high rainfall, can lead to
catastrophic loss of life and usable land <span class="citation"
data-cites="SILVAROTTA2020102119"><sup>213</sup></span>. Environmental
sustainability aside, mining has a poor safety and human rights
record <span class="citation"
data-cites="ResponsibleMiningIndex"><sup>214</sup></span>, and is
sometimes subject to dubious financing <span class="citation"
data-cites="MiningandMoneyLaundering"><sup>215</sup></span>. Mining of
‘conflict minerals’, such as tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold, used in
mobile phones and other quotidian products, are sometimes used to
finance armed conflict <span class="citation"
data-cites="EUConflictMinerals"><sup>216</sup></span>. Sustainability
regulations, both externally-imposed and voluntary, are slowly being
incorporated into the raw materials supply chains (see e.g., the
Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights <span class="citation"
data-cites="VoluntaryPrinciples"><sup>217</sup></span>, albeit slowly,
and in an inconsistent and sometimes superficial manner <span

<h3 id="life-cycle-assessment">Life-Cycle Assessment</h3>
<p>Best practices in sustainable use and disposal of resources begins
with a Life-Cycle Assessment: a cradle-to-grave accounting of all the
environmental impacts. As an example the ISO-Standards ISO 14040  <span
class="citation" data-cites="ISO14040"><sup>225</sup></span> and ISO
14044  <span class="citation"
data-cites="ISO14044"><sup>226</sup></span> are made to provide a
standardised procedure for the analysis. Depending on the goal and scope
of the analysis, the life-cycle inventory comprises the quantification
of all input and output flows. This includes raw materials, consumables,
energy, products, waste, emissions, and groundwater and soil
contamination. There are online tools and auditing agencies who provide
help with the analysis, e.g.  <span class="citation"
data-cites="ProBasSi"><sup>175</sup></span>. Alternatively procurement
teams or environmental/health departments at institutes for tertiary
education may be happy to take this on as their own research
project.</p>
<h3 id="sustainable-sourcing">Sustainable sourcing <span
id="sec:sustainablesourcing"
label="sec:sustainablesourcing"></span></h3>
<p>Where high-impact materials cannot be replaced with more sustainable
ones, purchasing policy can have a major impact. The HECAP+ community
should prioritise suppliers that implement sustainable thinking ,
sourcing, and operation. This could include voluntary provision of
Life-Cycle Assessments for their products (see above), or certification
of e.g., proof of origin.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> Even better would be
to have sustainability requirements incorporated in tenders and
purchasing regulations, that suppliers must comply with (e.g., proof of
origin, no child labor etc). Considerations of sustainability can then
be weighed in tandem with cost in selecting suppliers. Since much of
HECAP+ funding is public, purchasing regulations influenced by funding
agencies, which represent an additional important stakeholder in this
process, must be reassessed. For examples of best practice in
sustainable procurement see Best Practice <a
href="#bp:SustainableRawMaterials" data-reference-type="ref"

data-cites="owidco2andothergreenhousegasemissions"><sup>231</sup></span>.
This is despite a 60% decrease in the amount of waste landfilled in the

a 2018 European Commission study however, the cost of repair was the
most frequent reason consumers chose to replace four common household
electrical and electronic goods instead <span class="citation"
data-cites="ECConsumerStudy"><sup>237</sup></span> of repairing them.
Right-to-repair advocates are pushing for more comprehensive and
far-reaching legislation including policies that will empower consumers
to make simple repairs themselves, as well as government incentives to
repair through e.g., financial aid <span class="citation"

latter has already been implemented in France <span class="citation"
data-cites="FrenchRepairAid"><sup>239</sup></span>. However, today’s
legislation is formulated piecemeal and is slow to take effect. In
addition to instituting sustainable purchasing, use and
de-inventorising/disposal policies for electrical and electronic goods
(see Recommendations), HECAP+ institutions could encourage the
sustainable use of personal electronic devices by making available
repair equipment, with guidance from experts on a volunteer basis.</p>

<h3 id="plastic-waste">Plastic Waste</h3>
<p>Plastic is a versatile product, efficient, cheap, stable, and
infinitely moldable. Its unique properties have resulted in our
increasing reliance on it over decades, making it very hard to live
without.</p>
<p>GHG emissions from production, use and disposal of conventional
(fossil-fuel-based) plastics is significant, and growing. It is expected
to increase to <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span>2.1 <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{tCO}_2\mathrm{e}\)</span> per capita by
2040, accounting for almost 20% of the global carbon budget <span
class="citation" data-cites="UNPollutionSolution"><sup>241</sup></span>.
Under 10% of plastic waste produced to date has been recycled, with the
remainder being dumped or incinerated <span class="citation"
data-cites="UNPollutionSolution"><sup>241</sup></span>. This plastic
waste contaminates the natural environment. It is slow to degrade
(‘biodegradable’ plastics included), releasing potentially harmful
chemicals into the environment in the process, eventually breaking down
to micro- and nano-plastic particles that wind up in the food chain.
Microplastics are also found in waste water, due to washing of synthetic
textiles, and in cosmetic and personal care products <span
class="citation" data-cites="Microplastics"><sup>242</sup></span>. The
health impacts of ingested plastic waste are not yet completely
understood, but they are known to alter metabolic pathways and hormone
signalling in animals.</p>
<p>A simple ban on single-use plastics, and plastics that are not at
least 99% recyclable would greatly limit microplastic pollution.</p>
<h3 id="conference-waste">Conference Waste<span id="sec:ConferenceWaste"
label="sec:ConferenceWaste"></span></h3>
<p>The amount of waste generated at conferences could be significantly
reduced by e.g., keeping conference gifts digital (e-vouchers/discounts
for local restaurants or activities) or replacing printed timetables and
welcome packs with a well-designed conference app, see, e.g., Whova<span
class="citation" data-cites="Whova"><sup>243</sup></span>. Sustainable
stationery could be distributed on a need-only basis, and banners,
posters and nametags could be made plastic-free and reusable. For

delegates included:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>plastic-free cardboard name badges with bamboo lanyards and metal
clips</p></li>
<li><p>fabric tote bags give-aways with conference logo</p></li>
<li><p>no printed envelopes for registration packs, no printed
conference abstracts</p></li>
<li><p>any printing necessary was done on sustainably-sourced paper,
using a solar-powered printer</p></li>
<li><p>sustainably-sourced pencils instead of pens, with sharpening

<li><p>no packaged sweets</p></li>
<li><p>delegates were asked to bring reusable water bottles, or

<li><p>reusable, washable plates, cups silverware and glassware for all

<h3 id="sec:CateringTableware">Catering Tableware</h3>
<p>A life-cycle analysis by the UN Environment Programme concludes that
“reusable tableware consistently outperforms single-use tableware in all
the studies and across all environmental impact categories (with water
use being the exception, because of washing). This type of analysis
takes into account all the variables that affect the environmental
impact of a product, from manufacturing to end-of-life treatment. The
case for reusable tableware is strengthened in countries where renewable
energy makes up a high proportion of the grid mix and where end-of-life
treatment options are not well developed” <span class="citation"
data-cites="UNEP2021"><sup>245</sup></span>.</p>
<p>In outdoor or remote environments or ‘pop-up’ events with no fixed
catering facilities, where reusable tableware is impractical, single-use
biodegradable tableware is preferable to other single-use tableware if
it is industrially composted mixed in with food waste <span
class="citation" data-cites="UNEP2021"><sup>245</sup></span>.<a
href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Unlike emissions due to reusables, which are dominated by their use
phase due to repeated washing, the main impact of biodegradable
tableware is due to its production. For conventional plastic, a
significant role is also played by end-of-life management. Quantitative
analysis of their relative emissions is thus strongly dependent on
assumptions about manufacture and disposal, including the material
demand. On the practical side, to minimise this impact when planning
conference catering one should always choose the lightest-weight
disposable tableware fit for purpose, preferably manufactured in a
country with a significant proportion of renewables in its energy and
electricity mix. For a comparison of emissions due to different choices
of catering tableware see Case Study <a href="#cs:conferencetableware"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="cs:conferencetableware">[cs:conferencetableware]</a>.</p>
<div class="marginline">
<p><span><strong>Case Study : Comparing tableware for pop-up
catering<span id="cs:conferencetableware"
label="cs:conferencetableware"></span></strong></span><br />
Quantifying the environmental impact of single-use tableware is not
simply a matter of quantifying its GHG emissions, as it has a
significant impact across all environmental factors, including
acidification, eutrophication, human health, land use and water
depletion. For the purposes of this case study, however, we will focus
on its climate impact as the most urgent issue facing us today, and the
one with the most reliable and robust indicators for decision
making.</p>
<p>We will consider for benchmarking purposes a large-scale conference
with 1,000 attendees and informal lunchtime catering (i.e., with no
dishwashing capability), and compare the life-cycle emissions due to
tableware made from conventional plastics, which are disposed of by a
combination of incineration and landfill according to the European
average (presumed food remnants making them unsuitable for recycling),
and from biodegradable bioplastics, which are industrially composted
along with the food remnants.</p>
<p>We assume each set of tableware consists of a dinner plate and cup, a
knife and fork, and a paper napkin and tray mat, all manufactured to the
same size and thickness, but with possible differences in weight due to
their respective material densities. A full list of assumptions and
details of the analysis can be found in the original article <span
class="citation" data-cites="Fieschi2018"><sup>248</sup></span>.</p>
<p>The total emissions for 1,000 sets of conventional polystyrene
tableware is 221 kg <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\mathrm{e}\)</span>, as compared with
109 kg <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\mathrm{e}\)</span> for
the biodegradable bioplastic tableware, a saving of 112 kg <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\mathrm{e}\)</span>, around the
emissions of a flight from Paris to Geneva. Note that much of the
comparative advantage of the bioplastics comes from their end-of-life
treatment; their production is significantly more resource-intensive
than conventional plastic tableware.</p>
<p>It is difficult to compare these figures to those for reusable
tableware, since reliable, peer-reviewed studies that allow quantitative
comparison between all three types of tableware are hard to come by. For
the purposes of comparison, however, we include here the emissions cost
of 1,000 dishes and cups from a 2015 study by Italian plastics company
Pro.mo <span class="citation"
data-cites="PROMO2015"><sup>249</sup></span>. They put the total
emissions due to reusables at 26 kg <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\mathrm{e}\)</span>, with the
emissions due to conventional plastic dishes and cups (polypropylene in
this case) at 79 kg <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO}_2\mathrm{e}\)</span>.<a href="#fn35"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>Note that these figures are specific to the electricity and energy
mix of the European market, which has a large impact on the dominant
emissions in all cases: for production in the case of bioplastics,
production and incineration for conventional plastics, and washing for
reusables.</p>

<p>Our approach differs from existing estimates of the GHG footprint per
researcher in the divisor used to compute this quantity. We shared the
emissions per resource equally by the total number using that resource,
whether it be total number of employees, or research staff, or in the
case of large laboratories like CERN, the number of Users, rather than
using the same divisor throughout. For instance, while we divide the
commuting emissions for each institute by the total number of employees,
we assign the business travel emissions solely to the research staff,
assuming the support staff have negligible long-distance travel. For
concreteness we have colour-coded the per-researcher estimates in Table
<a href="#tab:ComparativeEmissionsData" data-reference-type="ref"

by the denominators used in their computation, with the colour key

<li id="fn5"><p>The left-most bar, the climate cost of having an
additional child, relies on the assumption that global emissions per
capita remain frozen at their 2005 value. The 2009 study from which this
estimate was taken <span class="citation"
data-cites="MURTAUGH200914"><sup>23</sup></span> also quotes results
assuming two alternative emissions scenarios considered in the 2007 IPCC
report: an ‘optimistic’ scenario, in which emissions per capita decrease
linearly to 0.5 <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{tCO}_2\mathrm{e}\)</span> by 2100, and a
‘pessimistic’ one, in which they increase linearly to 150% of their 2005
value of 4.3 <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{tCO}_2\mathrm{e}\)</span>. The systematic
uncertainty in the result due to this choice is huge, with the estimated
cost of having an additional child ranging from 4.6 <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{tCO}_2\mathrm{e}\)</span> in the
optimistic scenario, to 81 <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{tCO}_2\mathrm{e}\)</span> in the
pessimistic one. The lower and upper limits of this range were obtained
by dividing the lifetime emissions per child in each case, by the
average human lifespan, as reported in Ref. <span class="citation"
data-cites="UN2019"><sup>24</sup></span>, in the developed country in
question. This still raises the question of how responsibility for the
emissions of future generations should be allocated, given that children
are essential to the functioning of our society and institutions.<a

all default assumptions, except for toggling on the climate factor for
flights. Precise departure and arrival information was not used for
calculation of the flight footprint. Since some airports are not
included as possible destinations, the footprint was calculated from the
central train station in the origin city to the central train station in
the destination city, and the footprint of travel to the airport is
assumed negligible (in comparison to the flight). Train fares quoted are
for the most convenient train journeys from the central station in the
origin city to the central station at the destination. For longer
journeys, preference was given to itineraries with overnight trains to
maximise efficiency per euro spent, assuming savings on an additional
night in a hotel. For all overnight trains, quoted prices include
reservation in shared sleeper cabin. Female-only occupancy can be
specified. Note that in many cases there may be a limited number of
’super saver’ tickets that are available for purchase ahead of time. Air
fares were for the ‘best’ option available on Skyscanner <span
